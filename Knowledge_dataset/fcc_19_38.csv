COMMISSIONER JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
In 2015, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Fischer introduced bipartisan legislation to improve 
universal service by extending the reach of wireless broadband in rural communities.  They proposed to 
do this by providing incentives for wireless carriers to partition, disaggregate, and lease unused spectrum 
to smaller carriers serving rural areas.  This rulemaking builds on their proposal, which was featured in 
appropriations legislation from last year.  To this effort, I offer my full support.
I also offer my optimism.  That’s because at its core, universal service is the principle that no 
matter who you are or where you live you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 
21st century success.  This is a sacred responsibility under the law.  But we all know that the tools this 
agency is using have not been sufficient to get the job done.  Millions of Americans still lack access to 
affordable broadband, especially in rural communities.  So it’s a positive step that through this proceeding 
we evolve our thinking about universal service and recognize that spectrum policy tools can help bring 
advanced communication to remote areas.  
Now here’s the next step we should take if we want to be successful.  The partitioning, 
disaggregation, and leasing contemplated here will work better if our secondary markets can operate with 
full information.  Today, the place to go for information about who owns spectrum and who might sell or 
lease it is our Universal Licensing System.  But this database is opaque.  It’s not user friendly.  Moreover, 
it will only grow more complex and harder to use as we divide and divvy up licenses as contemplated 
here.  So I believe as we move forward with this proceeding, we need in parallel a proceeding that will 
improve this database and increase the transparency of spectrum ownership.  I hope my colleagues 
agree—and I look forward to making it happen.",0,FCC-19-22A5.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

By the Chief, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal 
Communications Commission (Commission) grants a limited waiver of the Commission’s Wireless 
Emergency Alerts (WEA) rules to permit Participating Commercial Mobile Service (CMS) Providers1 to 
participate in an end-to-end test of WEA that the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Office of Emergency 
Management (Milwaukee County OEM) proposes to conduct on April 11, 2019, at 1:45 p.m. Central 
Daylight Time (CDT), with a backup test scheduled for April 12, 2019, at 1:45 p.m. CDT.2  For the 
reasons discussed below, we grant the Milwaukee County OEM request, subject to certain conditions.
II. BACKGROUND
2. The WEA system allows authorized government entities to send geographically targeted 
emergency alerts to commercial wireless subscribers who have WEA-capable mobile devices, and whose 
commercial wireless service providers are Participating CMS Providers.3  The Commission’s rules 
prohibit the use of the WEA Attention Signal except during actual emergencies, authorized tests, and 
certain public service announcements.4  Additionally, the Commission’s rules allow testing of WEA 
functionality only in limited circumstances that currently do not include end-to-end WEA tests to the 
1 Participating CMS Providers are commercial mobile service providers that have elected voluntarily to transmit 
WEA alert messages.  47 CFR § 10.10(d), (f).
2 See Letter from Christine Westrich, OEM Director, Milwaukee County Office of Emergency Management, et al., 
to Gregory M. Cooke, Deputy Chief, Policy and Licensing Division, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, 
Federal Communications Commission (filed Mar. 12, 2019) (on file in PS Docket No. 15-91) (Milwaukee County 
Letter).  In a conversation with Bureau staff, Milwaukee County OEM proposes to utilize the same backup test date 
and time as the National Weather Service’s statewide tornado drill.
3 Commercial Mobile Alert System, PS Docket No. 07-287, Third Report and Order, 23 FCC Rcd 12561, 12575, 
para. 32 (2008) (stating the requirements for wireless providers volunteering to participate in WEA).
4 47 CFR § 10.520(d).  The Attention Signal is a loud, attention-grabbing, two-tone audio signal that uses 
frequencies and sounds identical to the attention signal used by the EAS.  Compare 47 CFR § 10.520 with 47 CFR § 
11.31(a)(2).

public.5  On November 1, 2016, the Commission adopted a Report and Order that amends the WEA 
testing rules to permit emergency managers to conduct end-to-end WEA tests to the public, to assess how 
WEA is working within their jurisdictions.6  The rules allowing such tests will not be effective until May 
1, 2019.7
3. The Milwaukee County Letter requests a waiver of the Commission’s rules to allow 
Participating CMS Providers to participate in an end-to-end WEA test on Thursday, April 11, 2019, at 
1:45 p.m. CDT, with a backup date of Friday, April 12, 2019, also at 1:45 p.m. CDT.8  The Milwaukee 
County Letter states that the test will be conducted by the Milwaukee County OEM, which is the primary 
alert and warning authority for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) in Milwaukee 
County, and will be held in conjunction with Wisconsin’s Tornado & Severe Weather Awareness Week.9  
According to the Milwaukee County Letter, “[b]y leveraging the existing opportunity to introduce the 
WEA test concurrent with the statewide tornado drill on April 11, OEM can capitalize on longstanding 
public awareness campaigns to increase understanding of WEA.”10  The Milwaukee County Letter also 
states that Southeastern Wisconsin is susceptible to severe spring flooding and occasional tornados.11  
Therefore, according to the Milwaukee County Letter, “it is imperative to test the system now before the 
FCC’s WEA end-to-end testing rules become effective” on May 1, 2019, as “[w]aiting until May to 
implement a program designed to deliver immediate warnings may endanger public safety and put lives at 
risk unnecessarily.”12
4.  The proposed Milwaukee County WEA test would allow Milwaukee County OEM to 
send an alert to the “All-County” polygon, covering the entirety of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin.13  The 
proposed WEA test message to be delivered to mobile devices would be: “This is a TEST of the 
Milwaukee County Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action needed.”14  Milwaukee County OEM 
does not intend this test to substitute for other scheduled tests of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) 
performed in conjunction with local broadcasters.15  Additionally, Milwaukee County OEM has 
5 47 CFR § 10.350.  Specifically, the Commission’s rules require Participating CMS Providers to participate in 
monthly tests initiated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and in periodic tests of WEA’s C-
Interface.  Id.

previously conducted a test of the WEA system in the FEMA IPAWS Lab and has another such test 
scheduled for March 20, 2019.16
5. The Milwaukee County Letter describes an extensive communications plan to notify the 
public about the April 11 WEA test.17  The objectives of the communications plan are to “[e]ngage 
[Milwaukee] County’s population through multiple channels, including earned media, social media 
advertising and elected officials’ constituent communications,” “[d]efine WEA as a component of the 
Emergency Alert System and a modern complement to physical outdoor warning sirens,” and “[p]osition 
OEM as the local emergency alert authority among stakeholders and thoughtleaders.”18  The Milwaukee 
County Letter notes that the communications plan will confirm to the public that the WEA messages are 
only a test, and that Milwaukee County will execute its comprehensive public information campaigns “no 
later than one week before [the] test, to educate the public on this new capability and assure them that the 
WEA alerts are only a test.”19  The Milwaukee County Letter also indicates that it has notified the 
relevant Participating CMS Providers to ensure that they are aware of the test.20  Additionally, Milwaukee 
County OEM is in the process of informing other stakeholders operating within and adjacent to 
Milwaukee County, including elected officials, law enforcement, fire/EMS agencies and Public Safety 
Answering Points (PSAPs), and will engage with other county emergency management agencies located 
within Wisconsin Emergency Management’s Southwest Region.21  
III. DISCUSSION
6. A provision of the Commission’s rules “may be waived by the Commission on its own 
motion or on petition if good cause therefor is shown.”22  The Commission may find good cause to extend 
a waiver, “if special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule and such deviation will serve 
the public interest.”23  We conclude that there is good cause to grant the Milwaukee County OEM waiver 
request for the WEA end-to-end test.
7. In light of the seasonal hazards, such as severe spring flooding and tornados, facing 
Milwaukee County, we are persuaded by the Milwaukee County Letter that the proposed WEA test will 
help to implement WEA as a valuable tool in delivering immediate warnings where emergencies may 
endanger public safety.24  Furthermore, we agree with Milwaukee County OEM’s determination that there 
is a benefit to leveraging the Tornado & Severe Weather Awareness Week to introduce the WEA test to 
the public.25  Given the value in coordination among state, local, and national agencies when engaging 
with the public in emergency preparedness exercises, we find waiver relief is warranted.  We believe that 
the proposed test would help educate and prepare the public, as well as assist emergency management 
officials to understand the alert origination and dissemination capabilities of all participants during state 
and local emergency preparedness exercises.  Rather than wait until after May 2019, we believe the 
proposed test would provide alert initiators and emergency managers information of immediate value.

Accordingly, we conclude that it is in the public interest to grant a limited waiver of the Commission’s 
WEA rules to Milwaukee County OEM in this instance.26
8. We observe, however, that the proposed Milwaukee County OEM WEA test would not be 
in the public interest if it was presented in a manner that could lead the public to conclude that an actual 
alert is being transmitted, or would otherwise confuse the public.27  We therefore condition this waiver 
upon the full implementation of the outreach plan described in the Milwaukee County Letter, including 
outreach to the public, press, and relevant government agencies, and making clear that members of the 
public may receive multiple test messages.
9. We further condition this waiver to require that the test may only be conducted on April 
11, 2019, at 1:45 p.m. CDT, as referenced in the Milwaukee County Letter, or on the backup date on April 
12, 2019, also at 1:45 p.m. CDT, and may only be conducted for the purposes described therein.  
Specifically, the waiver is based on representations that:
(1) this test is necessary to assess and validate the readiness and effectiveness of the 
emergency warning system, plans and infrastructure, and ability of participants to 
disseminate emergency messages to the public;
(2) Milwaukee County OEM has notified, and will coordinate with, the relevant 
Participating CMS Providers, elected officials, law enforcement, fire/EMS agencies, 
PSAPs, and other county emergency management agencies within Wisconsin 
Emergency Management’s Southeast Region to ensure that they are aware of the tests 
and can confirm to the public that the WEA message is a test; 
(3) pre-test publicity efforts will include a comprehensive media campaign, 
which will engage Milwaukee County’s population through multiple channels, 
including earned media, social media advertising, and elected officials’ constituent 
communications; 
(4) use of “test” wording as described by the Milwaukee County letter will be 
used in the test message; and 
(5) this test will not be a substitute for other scheduled tests of WEA or EAS.
10. We also require that the test and any post-test analysis and reports that Milwaukee County 
may conduct or cause to be produced, are done in a manner consistent with customers’ expectations of 
privacy, confidentiality of Participating CMS Providers’ network information, and the overall security of 
the WEA systems and infrastructure.28  We encourage Milwaukee County to report its test results in 
electronic format to the Bureau.  Finally, we encourage members of the public who wish to share feedback 
on their experience with the test to do so by filing them with the FCC’s Public Safety Support Center at 
https://www.fcc.gov/general/public-safety-support-center.
IV. ORDERING CLAUSE
11. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 4(i) of the Communications Act  
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 154(i), and Section 1.3 of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR § 1.3, 
26 These waivers do not extend to any other circumstances involving the broadcast or transmission of the WEA 
Attention Signal.
27 For example, transmitting a WEA test message without first informing emergency responders, such as 911 call  
centers, and the public about the test, could predictably result in confusion or panic.

separate statements.
I. INTRODUCTION
1. As part of the Commission’s continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to increase 
spectrum access by small and rural carriers, the Commission adopts this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
exploring how potential changes to our partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules might better serve 
those goals.  The Notice also satisfies the requirement under the Making Opportunities for Broadband 
Investment and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act),1 
which includes provisions requiring that the Commission take various actions concerning licensing, 
infrastructure, and deployment of wireless broadband services.  Among the provisions is a requirement 
that the Commission initiate a rulemaking to consider specific questions related to the partitioning or 
disaggregation of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access by small carriers.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Existing Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Spectrum Leasing Rules
2.Partitioning and Disaggregation.  Since its seminal 1996 CMRS Partitioning and 
Disaggregation Order,2 which adopted rules to permit geographic partitioning and spectrum 
disaggregation for Broadband PCS licenses, the Commission has adopted partitioning and disaggregation 
rules on a service-by-service basis as part of its long-held goal to provide licensees the “flexibility to 
determine the amount of spectrum they will occupy and the geographic area they will serve.”3  The 
1 MOBILE NOW Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Division P, Title VI, § 601 et seq. (2018).  The MOBILE NOW Act 
became law on March 23, 2018.

Commission continues to allow partitioning and disaggregation of licenses for all services categorized as 
Wireless Radio Services.4
3. The Commission’s partitioning and disaggregation rules apply to all “Covered 
Geographic Licenses,” which are defined to consist of specified wireless radio services for which the 
Commission has auctioned exclusive spectrum rights in defined geographic areas.5  Under these existing 
Commission rules, “geographic partitioning” is the assignment of a geographic portion of a geographic 
area licensee’s license area.6  “Spectrum disaggregation” is the assignment of portions of blocks of a 
geographic area licensee’s spectrum.7
4. Covered geographic area licensees currently may seek Commission approval for 
partitioning, disaggregation, or a combination of both, by filing FCC Form 603 as part of an application 
for a partial assignment of authorization, pursuant to section 1.948 of the Commission’s rules.8  The 
license term for a partitioned license area or disaggregated spectrum license is the remainder of the 
original licensee’s license term.9  Parties to a geographic partitioning, a spectrum disaggregation, or a 
combination of both have two options to satisfy service-specific performance requirements (i.e., 
construction and operation requirements).10  First, each party may certify that it will individually satisfy 
any service-specific requirements and, upon failure to do so, must individually face any service-specific 
performance penalties.  Alternatively, both parties may agree to share responsibility for any service-
specific requirements, and in the event of a failure to meet their shared service-specific performance 
requirements, both parties are subject to any service-specific penalties.
5. The Commission has received over 1,000 assignment applications involving partitioning 
and disaggregation pertaining to more than 4,000 licenses over the last 10 years.  These have included 
assignment applications in which larger providers assigned spectrum to smaller entities.11
6.Spectrum Leasing.  In 2003, the Commission adopted the first comprehensive set of rules 
to allow licensees in the Wireless Radio Services to enter into a variety of spectrum leasing

arrangements.12  In doing so, the Commission recognized the public interest benefits of permitting 
“additional spectrum users to gain ready access to spectrum,” thus enabling the “provision of new and 
diverse services and applications to help meet the ever-changing needs of the public.”13  Today, Subpart X 
of the Commission’s Part 1 rules establishes the requirements and procedures for spectrum leasing 
arrangements between licensees in the Wireless Radio Services.14
7. The Commission’s spectrum leasing rules apply to all “included services.”  These 
services are listed in section 1.9005 of the Commission’s rules and include Wireless Radio Services in 
which commercial or private licensees hold exclusive use rights.15  A “spectrum leasing arrangement” is 
an arrangement between a licensed entity and a third-party entity in which the licensee (spectrum lessor) 
leases certain of its spectrum usage rights in the licensed spectrum to the third-party entity, the spectrum 
lessee.16  The arrangement may involve the leasing of any amount of licensed spectrum, in any geographic 
area or site encompassed by the license, for any period of time during the term of the license 
authorization.  There are two different types of permissible spectrum leasing arrangements:  spectrum 
manager leasing arrangements and de facto transfer leasing arrangements.
8. A spectrum manager leasing arrangement is one in which the licensee/lessor retains de 
facto control of the licensed spectrum that it leases to the spectrum lessee.17  A licensee/lessor is deemed 
to have de facto control over the leased spectrum if it satisfies two conditions:  (i) the licensee/lessor 
retains responsibility for lessee compliance with Commission policy and rules; and (ii) the licensee/lessor 
retains responsibility for interactions with the Commission, including all filings, required under the 
license authorization and applicable service rules directly related to the leased spectrum.18  Subject to 
certain restrictions, spectrum manager leasing arrangements do not require prior Commission approval; 
rather, such arrangements are subject to certain notification requirements whereby the licensee/lessor 
must submit notice to the Commission of the arrangement in advance of commencing operations.19  While 
the licensee/lessor remains responsible for compliance with any construction and performance 
requirements applicable to the leased spectrum, the licensee/lessor may attribute to itself the build-out or

and Party B holding 15 megahertz over the entire EA.  We note that parties can also disaggregate and partition in 
combination, such as where Party A holds 30 megahertz of spectrum in an EA and assigns 5 megahertz in County X 
to Party B, resulting in Party A holding 25 megahertz in County X and 30 megahertz elsewhere in the EA, and Party 
B holding 5 megahertz only in County X.

performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such requirements.20
9. A de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangement is an arrangement in which the 
licensee/lessor is generally relieved of the responsibility for ensuring that the spectrum lessee’s operations 
comply with the Communications Act and Commission policies and rules.21  De facto transfer spectrum 
leasing arrangements can be either long-term (more than one year)22 or short-term (one year or less).23  In 
general, de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangements are subject to the Commission’s general 
approval procedures, under which the licensee/lessor and proposed lessee must file an FCC Form 608, 
and the Commission must grant the application prior to the parties’ putting the proposed spectrum leasing 
arrangement into effect.24  Both long-term and short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing applications 
are subject to overnight processing under the Commission’s immediate approval procedures if the filing 
meets certain conditions.25  If a long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing application is not granted 
under the immediate approval procedures, the application is placed on an accepted for filing public notice 
(usually for 14 days) before the Commission may act on the filing.  Short-term de facto transfer spectrum 
leasing applications do not require advance public notice prior to Commission action.  A licensee/lessor 
that enters into a long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangement may attribute to itself the 
buildout or performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such 
requirements; a licensee/lessor may not do so under a short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing 
arrangement.26
10. The Commission has received more than 8,000 spectrum lease applications and 
notifications pertaining to approximately 26,000 licenses over the last 10 years.
B. Statutory Requirement
11. Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act requires that, within a year of its enactment, the 
Commission: 
[I]nitiate a rulemaking proceeding to assess whether to establish a program, or modify existing 
programs, under which a licensee that receives a license for exclusive use of spectrum in a 
specific geographic area under section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301) 
may partition or disaggregate the license by sale or long-term lease-

year in length, or 10 days advance notice for arrangements of one year or less in length).  The Commission reviews 
the notifications to ensure that all necessary technical and other information is correctly submitted, but the subject 
spectrum leasing arrangement may be implemented without waiting for such review, unless the parties to the 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement have requested on the form that the arrangement become effective upon 
Commission acceptance of the notification.  Spectrum manager leasing applications require no prior public notice 
before the Commission may accept them.

(A) in order to-
(i) provide services consistent with the license; and 
(ii) make unused spectrum available to-
(I) an unaffiliated covered small carrier; or (II) an unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural 
area; and
(B) if the Commission finds that such a program would promote- (i) the availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas; or (ii) spectrum availability for covered 
small carriers.27
12. Section 616 requires the Commission to consider four questions in conducting the 
rulemaking.  First, would “reduced performance requirements with respect to the spectrum obtained 
through the program . . . facilitate deployment of advanced telecommunications services in areas covered 
by the program”?28  Second, “what conditions may be needed on transfers of spectrum under the program 
to allow covered small carriers that obtain spectrum under the program to build out the spectrum obtained 
under the program in a reasonable period of time”?29  Third, “what incentives may be appropriate to 
encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum, including (i) extending the term of a license . . . or (ii) 
modifying performance requirements of the license relating to the leased or sold spectrum”?30  And 
fourth, what is “the administrative feasibility” of those incentives and of “other incentives considered by 
the Commission that further the goals of [Section 616]”?31  Section 616 provides, however, that the 
Commission “may offer a licensee incentives or reduced performance requirements under this section 
only if the Commission finds that doing so would likely result in increased availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in a rural area.”32  Additionally, Section 616 directs that, “[i]f a party fails to 
meet any build out requirements set by the Commission for any spectrum sold or leased under this 
section, the right to the spectrum shall be forfeited to the Commission unless the Commission finds that 
there is good cause for the failure of the party.”33
13. In establishing its dual goals of making spectrum available to small carriers and 
promoting the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas, Section 616 defines 
two key terms.  “Covered small carrier” is a carrier34 that “(A) has not more than 1,500 employees (as 
determined under section 121.106 of title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto); and 
(B) offers services using the facilities of the carrier.”35  And “rural area” is any area other than “(A) a city,

31 Id. § 616(b)(2)(D).
32 Id. § 616(b)(4).
33 Id. § 616(b)(3).
34 Section 616 directs the Commission to use the definition of “carrier” contained in section 3 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, which defines a carrier as “any person engaged as a common carrier for hire, in 
interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy . . . but a 
person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.”

contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants.”36
III. DISCUSSION
14. The Commission’s existing partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules are designed to 
facilitate spectrum access and encourage secondary market transactions that will lead to efficient use of 
spectrum.  Today, we seek comment on whether to establish a program, or modify existing programs, for 
the partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing of licenses.  We also seek comment on what, if any, changes 
would promote the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum 
availability for covered small carriers—such as allowing additional time to meet performance obligations 
under certain circumstances.  We also ask commenters to address three considerations set forth in Section 
616, including addressing the administrative feasibility of each consideration; they are:  (1) whether 
reduced performance requirements applicable to partitioned or disaggregated licenses would promote the 
availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum availability for covered 
small carriers; (2) what conditions may be needed to eliminate impediments to transfers of spectrum to 
covered small carriers to allow them to build out in a reasonable period of time; and (3) what incentives 
may encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that 
will serve rural areas.  We seek to develop a record on the success of the Commission’s existing rules and 
therefore seek comment on whether further Commission action would likely promote the availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and facilitate access to spectrum by covered small 
carriers.
A. Reduced Performance Requirements In Rural Areas
15. We seek comment on whether reduced performance requirements for partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses would facilitate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services in rural 
areas.  The Commission’s rules permit parties to a partition or disaggregation to agree either to share the 
responsibility for meeting performance requirements or to satisfy the requirements individually.  We seek 
comment on potential modifications to these requirements that may be likely to increase service to rural 
areas, and on how to ensure that reduced performance requirements do not lead to reduced service in rural 
areas.
16. The Commission could adjust the performance requirements applicable to partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses either substantively (e.g., through reduced buildout requirements) or temporally 
(e.g., by extending deadlines for performance).  We seek comment on what, if any, such adjustments may 
be appropriate in this context.  Would the reduced performance requirements apply to the original 
licensee, the entity gaining access to the spectrum, or both?  Would a reduced buildout requirement in 
rural areas promote deployment in those areas, which might otherwise go unserved?  If so, how?  Would 
an extended deadline for performance increase a licensee’s ability and likelihood to provide service in 
rural areas?  How would the Commission ensure that any reduction in performance requirements results 
in increased rural area deployment?  Would the Commission have to pair reduced performance 
requirements with increased oversight, and subsequently increased penalties if these performance 
requirements are not met?  Is there a minimum set of performance requirements that are necessary to 
ensure adequate buildout?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to rural areas 
under differing levels of potential performance requirements?
17. With respect to our goal of promoting advanced telecommunications service in rural",5,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"under differing levels of potential performance requirements?
17. With respect to our goal of promoting advanced telecommunications service in rural 
areas, we seek comment on whether, for example, to extend by one year a receiving party’s construction 
deadline for a partitioned or disaggregated license when (i) the receiving party is a rural carrier or is 
acquiring spectrum that includes “rural areas,” as defined by Section 616, and (ii) the receiving party 
elects to meet the construction requirement independently for its partitioned or disaggregated license area.  
36 Id. § 616(a)(2).
1763",5,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
Under this scenario, to receive the one-year extension, should the party receiving the spectrum provide 
service to a certain percentage of the “rural areas” within its license area, such as 25 percent?  Is 25 
percent the appropriate metric to qualify for any rural area service extension, or should the percentage be 
higher, lower, or dependent upon some other factor, such as the size of the receiving party’s license area?  
Should the receiving party’s license area contain some minimum amount of “rural area” to qualify for the 
one-year extension?  We seek to facilitate transactions that will promote rural deployment by providing 
relief that will substantially benefit licensees.  As parties may not need construction relief early in a ten-
year license term, should we only apply an extension to transactions occurring within a certain timeframe, 
for example, no sooner than three years from the construction deadline?  Conversely, our rules provide 
that extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a construction or coverage deadline because 
the licensee undergoes a transfer of control or because the licensee intends to assign the authorization.37  
To prevent filing a transaction and extension request late in the construction period to avoid loss of 
license, should we limit any one-year construction extension to requests filed no later than six months 
before the construction deadline, or some other appropriate timeframe?
18. Should the one-year extension apply to interim construction requirements, final 
requirements, or both?  For a license that receives a one-year extension for its final performance 
requirement, should the Commission also extend by one year the license term where the final construction 
deadline is coincident with renewal?  If not, what would be the effect of the extension on the license’s 
required renewal showing?  Similarly, what would be the effect of the extension on the license’s 
continuity of service obligations?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to rural 
areas with and without a one-year extension?  What would be the costs and benefits to delaying 
construction in rural areas?  How would we compare the cost of the potential short-term delay in 
construction to the potential long-term benefit of an increase in service to rural areas?
19. Commenters advocating for these specific approaches, or for other approaches involving 
reduced performance requirements, should discuss how they would be implemented, including how and 
when they would take effect, to whom they would apply, and any specific conditions that should apply.  
Commenters should also describe in detail how any such implementation would serve to promote the 
availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas.  Further, in light of Section 616’s 
requirement that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of implementing reduced 
performance requirements, commenters should discuss the costs and benefits of any proposed 
implementation.  How would these costs and benefits be measured?
B. Conditions on Transfers of Spectrum to Covered Small Carriers
20. As a threshold matter, the MOBILE NOW Act directs the Commission to focus on 
programs that would promote spectrum availability for “covered small carriers,” a term that as noted 
above encompasses only common carriers.38  While we seek comment below on issues relating to 
“covered small carriers,” as required, we also seek comment on whether we should consider applying any 
rule revisions to an expanded class of licensees beyond those Congress requires us to consider.  Would 
expanding the rule revisions serve the purposes of the MOBILE NOW Act, including the purpose of 
promoting “the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas”?  If commenters 
believe the Section 616 definition of “covered small carrier” is under-inclusive,39 they should describe",6,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

what category or categories of licensee should be subject to any Commission rule change, the effects of 
applying any rule changes to entities that are not common carriers, how the Commission should adjust our 
rules to better meet our goals in this proceeding of facilitating secondary markets transactions, and the 
costs and benefits of such an approach.
21. We seek comment on what conditions may be needed on transfers of spectrum to allow 
covered small carriers to build out in a reasonable period.  We seek comment on whether there are 
procedural barriers to partitioning or disaggregation that limit the utility of those programs for covered 
small carriers.  Are there certain parties that are currently foreclosed from partitioning, disaggregating, or 
leasing spectrum due to such barriers, that might otherwise make use of the existing programs in the 
absence of those barriers?  If so, we seek comment on the nature of those barriers and the types of entities 
that are currently foreclosed.
22. In addition to procedural barriers to partitioning and disaggregation, we seek comment on 
whether there are substantive barriers with respect to covered small carriers’ ability to satisfy performance 
requirements applicable to the partitioned or disaggregated spectrum.  Do covered small carriers require 
reduced or modified performance requirements in order to successfully build out the spectrum obtained 
through such arrangements?  Would reduced construction obligations for an entire license area lead to 
increased construction or service for certain parts of that market?  Would extended performance deadlines 
increase the number of covered small carriers that are willing and able to obtain spectrum through 
partitioning, disaggregation, or lease arrangements?  How could the Commission ensure that a reduction 
in construction requirements does not lead to a reduction in services deployed?  Would the reduced 
obligations apply to the original licensee, the entity gaining access to the spectrum, or both?  For example, 
would a one-year construction requirement extension, akin to that discussed above with respect to 
transactions involving rural carriers, be appropriate for transfer of spectrum to covered small carriers?  
Commenters advocating any special conditions for covered small carriers should describe in detail the 
extent to which such conditions are necessary or likely to increase covered small carrier participation in 
the Commission’s existing or new partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing programs. 
23. As stated, the Commission has received more than 1,000 assignment applications 
involving partitioned or disaggregated licenses over the last 10 years, which included assignment 
applications in which larger providers assigned spectrum to smaller entities.  We seek comment on 
whether our current rules promote the efficient level of secondary market transactions.  What are the costs 
and benefits, if the rules were to be changed?
24. We seek comment on these and any other relevant considerations regarding special 
conditions for covered small carriers that obtain access to spectrum through partition or disaggregation.  
Commenters should discuss in detail both the necessity and the likelihood of any such conditions 
resulting in increased spectrum availability for covered small carriers.  Further, in light of the Section 616 
requirement that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of special conditions for covered 
small carriers, commenters should also discuss the costs and benefits of any conditions they advocate.  
What are the potential costs of modified performance requirements in terms of speed and quality of 
deployment?  What are the benefits in terms of increased coverage and quality of service, including in 
rural areas?  How would these costs and benefits be measured?
C. Incentives To Encourage Lease or Sale",7,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"rural areas?  How would these costs and benefits be measured?
C. Incentives To Encourage Lease or Sale
25. In light of Section 616’s requirement that we consider incentives that might encourage 
licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural 
areas, we seek comment on what, if any, incentives may be appropriate to achieve this end, including 
license term extensions or modified performance requirements.  Are there certain substantive or 
procedural barriers to leasing that inefficiently limit use of the program by spectrum licensees?  For 
example, where our spectrum leasing rules require Commission consent to an application prior to 
consummation, does the administrative burden of seeking such prior approval act to deter such 
transactions, and, if so, do such disincentives have a disproportionate effect on transactions with covered 
1765",7,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that seek to provide service to rural areas?  Would a longer license 
term or modified performance requirements be effective in counteracting those administrative burdens?
26. As stated, the Commission processed over 8,000 spectrum lease applications in the last 
10 years.  We seek comment on whether our existing secondary markets rules are sufficiently flexible to 
provide adequate incentives for licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights to covered small carriers or 
unaffiliated carriers that seek to provide service to rural areas.  For example, in addition to earning 
revenue from such transactions, licensees that enter into long-term leases may attribute the buildout and 
performance activities of the lessee for purposes of satisfying the licensee’s own performance 
obligations.40  Are such incentives sufficient to encourage licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights to 
such carriers?  We seek comment on the effectiveness of existing benefits of sale or lease, and whether 
further incentives would be likely to encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum.
27. We seek comment on whether and how modified performance requirements or longer 
license terms might encourage more licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights.  Commenters should 
discuss the incremental benefits of increasing the number of spectrum sales or leases relative to the 
potential collateral effects that such incentives may have.  For example, while reduced buildout 
requirements may increase the number of licensees willing to lease spectrum, it may also decrease 
deployment of advanced wireless services in those license areas as a result of the reduced performance 
requirements.  We therefore seek comment on the specific costs and benefits of any incentives that 
commenters advocate and the relative weight the Commission should apply in evaluating whether those 
incentives would be likely to result in increased availability of advanced telecommunications services in 
rural areas.  Would the Commission have to pair reduced performance requirements with increased 
oversight, and subsequently increased penalties if these performance requirements are not met?  Is there a 
minimum set of performance requirements that are necessary to ensure adequate buildout?  In cases 
where the party receiving the spectrum is an unaffiliated carrier that will serve rural areas, how can we 
ensure adequate buildout to rural areas?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to 
rural areas under differing levels of potential performance requirements?
28. We also seek comment on whether allowing spectrum “reaggregation” for spectrum that 
has been partitioned or disaggregated on the secondary market—up to the size of the original market 
area—would increase the incentives of parties to lease or sell spectrum in the first place, and thus 
ultimately meet the dual goals of increasing the availability of advanced telecommunications services in 
rural areas and facilitating access to spectrum by covered small carriers.  Under our current rules, while 
licensees may partition and disaggregate their licenses through spectrum transactions, there is no 
provision for reaggregating spectrum, even when the partitioned or disaggregated portions of an original 
market area are acquired by a single entity.  Holding multiple licenses for what was once a single license 
may impose certain regulatory and administrative burdens on licensees, including construction 
requirements, renewal showings, continuous service requirements, and the need to maintain up-to-date 
information in ULS.  In the context of other proceedings, some parties have asked the Commission to 
allow reaggregation of spectrum to ease these burdens.41  We seek comment on the relationship between 
reducing these burdens and incentivizing spectrum transactions.",8,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"allow reaggregation of spectrum to ease these burdens.41  We seek comment on the relationship between 
reducing these burdens and incentivizing spectrum transactions.
29. One potential disadvantage of allowing reaggregation is that carriers may attempt to use 
it to avoid construction requirements.  Should we only permit spectrum reaggregation where the licensee 
has already met its construction obligations with respect to the reaggregated spectrum?  Should other 
conditions apply before reaggregation is allowed to ensure that construction requirements for both areas

spectrum to meet the performance requirements of the original market area?  What filings and/or 
showings could we require the licensee to make to expedite Commission review of construction 
obligations in reaggregated spectrum?  If spectrum reaggregation were allowed, what safeguards should 
the Commission put in place to prevent entities from using the process as a way of “laundering” their 
regulatory obligations?

of service obligations with respect to the reaggregated spectrum?  If so, what measures could the 
Commission put in place to ensure that licensees comply with these requirements?  What filings and/or 
showings could we require the licensee to make to expedite Commission review?  Again, we seek 
comment on what safeguards the Commission should put in place to ensure that licensees potentially 
permitted to reaggregate their licenses meet regulatory obligations with respect to renewal and continuity 
of service.  Would the Commission have to pair reaggregation with increased oversight, and subsequently 
increased penalties if certain buildout thresholds are not met?  How would the Commission measure the 
change in service to rural areas with and without spectrum reaggregation?  Would there be a chance that a 
reaggregated license would cause a barrier to entry for other providers, thereby potentially reducing 
buildout in rural areas?  What are the other costs and benefits that may be associated with reaggregation?  
We note that legal, policy, and technical review—and adjustments to license and map files—would be 
required in order for Commission staff to process what could be hundreds of reaggregation applications a 
year.  These filings would compete with the many other filings before Commission staff for their 
attention. 
31. If commenters advocate for incentives such as modified performance requirements, 
longer license terms, spectrum reaggregation, or another incentive, they should describe in detail how the 
incentive would likely increase the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or 
facilitate access to spectrum by covered small carriers.  Further, in light of the Section 616 requirement 
that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of providing incentives to lease or sell 
spectrum, commenters should also discuss the costs and benefits of any incentives they advocate.  How 
would these costs and benefits be measured?

13APPENDIX
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in this 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice).  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.  
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments 
on the Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or 
summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2.As part of the Commission’s continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to increase 
spectrum access by small and rural carriers, the Commission adopts this Notice exploring how potential 
changes to our partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules might better serve those goals.  The Notice 
also satisfies the Commission’s requirement under the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment 
and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act),4 which includes 
provisions requiring that the Commission take various actions concerning licensing, infrastructure, and 
deployment of wireless broadband services.  Among those provisions is a requirement that the 
Commission initiate a rulemaking to consider specific questions related to partitioning or disaggregation 
of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access by covered small carriers.
B. Legal Basis
3. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 303, and 310(d) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i), 303, 310(d), and Pub. L. No. 115-141, Div. P, 
Title VI, § 616, 132 Stat. 348.
C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
4. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.5  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”6  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.7  A small business

after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public 
comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and

concern is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.8
5.Small Businesses, Small Organizations, and Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our 
action may, over time, affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore 
describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.9  
First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory 
flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is 
an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.10  These types of small businesses represent 
99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 28.8 million businesses.11
6. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”12  
Nationwide, as of August 2016, there were approximately 356,494 small organizations based on 
registration and tax data filed by nonprofits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).13
7. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”14  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 Census 
of Governments15 indicates that there were 90,056 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16  Of this number there were 
37,132 general purpose governments (county,17 municipal, and town or township18) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,184 special purpose governments (independent school districts19 and special 
districts20) with populations of less than 50,000.  The 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data for most types of 
governments in the local government category shows that the majority of these governments have 
populations of less than 50,000.21  Based on this data we estimate that at least 49,316 local government

13 Data from the Urban Institute, National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) reporting on nonprofit 
organizations registered with the IRS was used to estimate the number of small organizations.  Reports generated 
using the NCCS online database indicated that as of August 2016 there were 356,494 registered nonprofits with total 
revenues of less than $100,000.  Of this number, 326,897 entities filed tax returns with 65,113 registered nonprofits 
reporting total revenues of $50,000 or less on the IRS Form 990-N for Small Exempt Organizations and 261,784 
nonprofits reporting total revenues of $100,000 or less on some other version of the IRS Form 990 within 24 months 
of the August 2016 data release date.  See http://nccsweb.urban.org/tablewiz/bmf.php, where the report showing this

jurisdictions fall in the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”22
8.Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.23  The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small 
if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.24  For this industry, U.S. Census data for 2012 show that there were 
967 firms that operated for the entire year.25  Of this total, 955 firms had employment of 999 or fewer 
employees and 12 had employment of 1,000 employees or more.26  Thus, under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications 
carriers (except satellite) are small entities.
9. The Commission has determined from data available in its Universal Licensing System 
that there are approximately 1,095 unique licensees corresponding to more than 40,000 licenses in the 
Wireless Radio Services that could be affected by this Notice, as of February 21, 2019.27  The

Commission does not know how many licensees in these bands are small entities, as the Commission 
does not collect that information for these types of entities.
D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities
10. The proposed actions in the Notice, if adopted, may impose reporting, recordkeeping and 
other compliance requirements on small entities as well as other licensees.  For example, there are 
potential changes to performance requirements that could alter existing, or create additional, 
recordkeeping and compliance obligations for small entities as well as other licensees.  Specifically, the 
Notice seeks comment on whether to reduce performance requirements for partitioned or disaggregated 
licenses to facilitate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and access to 
spectrum by covered small carriers.  The Notice also asks whether the Commission would have to pair 
reduced performance requirements with increased oversight, and whether reduced performance 
requirements would apply to the licensee, the entity gaining access to spectrum, or both.  The Notice 
directs commenters advocating for reduced performance requirements to discuss how they would apply 
and be implemented, any specific conditions that would apply, how and when they would take effect, and 
the costs and benefits of any proposed implementation, including how the costs and benefits should be 
measured.
11. To advance the Commission’s goal of promoting advanced telecommunications service 
in rural areas, the Notice explores whether there should be changes to construction deadlines and how any

"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
modified deadlines should be applied.  In this regard, the Notice seeks comment on whether to extend by 
one year the performance requirement deadline for a party receiving partitioned or disaggregated 
spectrum if certain conditions are met, including that the license is partitioned or disaggregated to a rural 
carrier or includes a certain amount of “rural areas,” as defined by Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW 
Act, and the party receiving the spectrum independently meets the construction requirements.  The Notice 
asks whether a similar extension should apply with respect to transactions involving “covered small 
carriers,” as defined by Section 616.  Recognizing that the MOBILE NOW Act’s definition of “covered 
small carriers” encompasses only common carriers, the Notice seeks comment on whether the 
Commission should consider applying any rule revisions stemming from this proceeding to an expanded 
class of licensees beyond those Congress requires it to consider, and the effects of any rule changes to 
entities that are not common carriers.  If the Commission were to adopt this type of one-year extension of 
performance requirement deadlines, it could also potentially impact both renewal and continuity of 
service obligations for licensees.  The Notice asks what the effect of the extension would be on these 
obligations, and asks whether the license term should also be extended where a receiving party’s final 
construction deadline is coincident with renewal.
12.Spectrum Transfers.  The Notice asks what, if any, rule changes may be necessary 
relating to transfers of spectrum to allow covered small carriers to obtain spectrum through partitioning, 
disaggregation, or lease arrangements.  In particular, the Notice seeks comment on whether reduced or 
modified performance requirements or extended performance deadlines would aid and increase the 
successful build out by covered small carriers who obtain spectrum through partitioning, disaggregation, 
or lease arrangements.  Further, in light of Section 616’s requirement that the Commission consider the 
administrative feasibility of special conditions for covered small carriers, the Notice seeks comment on 
the costs and benefits of any proposed changes or conditions.
13.Incentives to Encourage Lease or Sale.  In light of Section 616’s requirement that the 
Commission consider incentives that might encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small 
carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural areas, the Notice seeks comment on what, if any, 
incentives may be appropriate to meet this objective, and how these potential incentives may impact the 
recordkeeping and compliance obligations of covered small carriers.  In particular, the Notice seeks 
comment on whether and how modified performance requirements or longer license terms might 
encourage more licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights; specific costs and benefits of any 
incentives; whether to pair reduced performance requirements with increased oversight; whether a 
minimum set of performance requirements would be necessary to ensure adequate buildout; and whether 
there should be increased penalties if performance requirements are not met.  Additionally, the Notice 
seeks comment on whether allowing spectrum “reaggregation” for spectrum that has been partitioned or 
disaggregated on the secondary market—up to the size of the original market area—would help 
incentivize more parties to lease or sell spectrum.  If spectrum reaggregation were allowed, the Notice 
asks what safeguards the Commission should put in place to prevent entities from using the process as a 
way of “laundering” their regulatory obligations.  It also asks whether the Commission should require that 
licensees meet renewal requirements and continuity of service obligations with respect to the",16,FCC-19-22A1_Rcd.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"licensees meet renewal requirements and continuity of service obligations with respect to the 
reaggregated spectrum, and if so, what measures the Commission should put in place to ensure that 
licensees comply with these requirements.  The Notice further asks what filings and/or showings the 
licensee could be required to make to expedite Commission review.
14. While the Commission is not currently in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the 
potential rule changes that could result from questions raised in the Notice will require small entities to 
hire attorneys, engineers, consultants, or other professionals, and cannot quantify the cost of compliance 
with the potential rule changes that could be adopted, it does not believe that the costs and/or 
administrative burdens associated with any of the potential rule changes will unduly burden small entities.  
In the discussion of these potential rule changes, the Commission has sought comments from parties in 
the proceeding, including seeking cost and benefit analyses.  These may help the Commission identify 
and evaluate other relevant matters, including compliance costs and burdens on small entities that may 
result from the matters explored in the Notice.

"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
15. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, 
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following 
four alternatives (among others):  “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the 
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for 
small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from 
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof for small entities.”28
16. In the Notice, the Commission has raised alternatives to facilitate changes that would 
promote the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum availability 
for covered small carriers—such as allowing additional time to meet performance obligations under 
certain circumstances.  The Commission has also sought to identify and target for removal procedural and 
substantive barriers impacting covered small carriers relating to partitioning, disaggregating, or leasing 
spectrum. In addition, the Commission has raised questions to address what conditions may be needed to 
eliminate impediments to transfers of spectrum to covered small carriers to allow them to build out in a 
reasonable period of time, and identify what incentives may encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum 
to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural areas.
17. The Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small entities 
following its review of comments filed in response to the Notice, including costs and benefits analyses, 
and this IFRA.  The Commission’s evaluation of the comments filed in this proceeding will shape the 
final conclusions it reaches, the final alternatives it considers, and the actions it ultimately takes in this 
proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities.

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
The recent Netflix series, “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,” has launched a phenomenon as 
Americans embrace Marie’s special way of keeping a tidy home.  A key to the KonMari method is 
effectively managing your possessions by keeping only those that “spark joy.”  For the FCC, spectrum 
that is being put to productive use sparks joy.  Spectrum that lies fallow does not.  That’s why we allow 
license holders to partition, disaggregate, or lease spectrum so more of it can be more easily used.
To ensure we do that as effectively as possible, today’s Notice tees up many questions regarding 
the Commission’s partitioning and disaggregation rules (which allow a spectrum license to be broken up 
into smaller pieces), as well as our leasing rules.  We’re aiming to figure out whether any changes to 
those rules would help small carriers and wireless Internet service providers get better access to spectrum, 
such as by encouraging spectrum licensees to lease or sell spectrum to small companies serving rural 
areas.  Additionally, in order to fulfill our obligations under the MOBILE NOW Act, we seek comment 
on whether a change to performance requirements could help rural telecommunications services and 
smaller providers.  And we’re also looking at how reaggregating previously separated licenses might 
encourage deployment of additional services.  In short, we want to explore ways to improve wireless 
access in parts of this country—and I’ve seen many of them—that too often are on the wrong side of the 
digital divide.  I’m looking forward to reviewing the record on these questions to find the appropriate way 
forward.  And I do hope it sparks joy, of course.

COMMISSIONER MICHAEL O’RIELLY
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
I approve today’s notice seeking input on how the Commission’s secondary market policies can 
increase deployment in rural areas and facilitate the ability of small wireless providers to access spectrum.  
Congress required that we conduct – and I wholeheartedly support – such a review. 
By way of background, the Commission has policies in place to facilitate secondary market 
transactions.  Licenses can be sold or leased, in whole or in part, with overnight approval for many of the 
applications and notices for such deals.  In fact, the Commission has conducted similar reviews in the 
past, which resulted in the introduction of leasing and expedited processing where appropriate.  While the 
Commission has streamlined its procedures and provided flexibility under our rules to facilitate deals in 
rural America and to get spectrum into the hands of small businesses, many still assert that a vibrant 
secondary market, involving rural and small entities, has not developed.
 
The most common obstacle involves the simple fact that, often, it just isn’t worth a current 
licensee’s time to consider a small deal.  Basically, the cost of negotiations and paperwork can outweigh 
the economic gains for spectrum in a more remote area.  Therefore, our conversation must focus on how 
to reduce such burdens so that those with some excess spectrum in less populated areas are willing to 
enter into transactions.  Not an easy task, I admit. 
While the notice offers some ideas, they are far from likely to open the secondary market 
floodgates.  I am somewhat skeptical that reducing performance requirements, providing some additional 
time for construction, or extending the license terms for operators that lease or sell spectrum will make a 
substantial difference.  Regardless, I am more than happy to engage with interested parties on any of these 
ideas and others that they may have.  
Ultimately, I hope industry will take this opportunity to think out of the box about ways – 
including approaches requiring Commission action or industry best practices – to meaningfully lower 
transaction costs and time spent so that those with spectrum are truly incentivized to execute the requisite 
deals.  One way to reduce costs and hasten deal making could be to create a database or exchange that 
contains operator-approved contracts and available spectrum – an operational template, if you will.  If an 
entity is willing to accept a contract as is, it could be submitted to the operator electronically, reducing 
prolonged back-and-forth negotiations and the requisite legal work.  But, I recognize that it will likely 
take some greater effort to get license holders to participate and use advanced technologies that can 
inherently automate, record, and execute deals without emotion or competitive concerns and that hold 
interesting possibilities.  
I thank the Chairman and Congress for starting this important discussion, but this proceeding will 
only be as good as the thought that goes into it.  I hope wireless providers – big and small, urban and rural 
– really take the time to consider this issue and provide creative solutions.

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
A few months ago, I had the chance to meet Whitney from Lambert, Montana.  Her family runs a 
farming and ranching operation in the northeast corner of Big Sky Country.  The area is famous for being 
the farthest place in the country from a Starbucks.  It’s about 190 miles to the closest green-aproned 
barista.  A run to the grocery store is a 100-mile drive round trip.  The nearest big city, Billings, is five 
and a half hours away.  
Yet Whitney is an Instagram star.  She makes money by using her smartphone to produce and 
upload what have become viral videos.  She calls one of her more famous videos “CrossFit for Cows,”29 
and it’s been viewed millions of times.  It shows Ghost, one of her 1,200 pound Herefords, rolling a straw 
bale across a snow-covered field.  Whitney can get 4G LTE when she’s in the field because there’s a cell 
tower not far away that was put up to cover a highway that runs through the area.  But there are still too 
many people in rural America that can’t get a 4G LTE signal.
And that is why the FCC is working on a number of fronts to help close this digital divide.  We 
have allocated up to $4.5 billion to bring 4G LTE to more Americans.  We have streamlined broadband 
infrastructure rules.  And we have sought comment on expanding the FCC’s existing geographic coverage 
requirements.30
Today, we tee up another option for increasing wireless service in rural America.  As required by 
Congress in the MOBILE NOW Act, we seek comment on how our spectrum leasing and related rules 
can help promote wireless deployment in areas that might otherwise go unserved.
Now, everyone may not have the same social media skills as Whitney, but they should at least 
have the same opportunity at next-gen connectivity.  So I support today’s Notice, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on these important issues.

COMMISSIONER JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
In 2015, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Fischer introduced bipartisan legislation to improve 
universal service by extending the reach of wireless broadband in rural communities.  They proposed to 
do this by providing incentives for wireless carriers to partition, disaggregate, and lease unused spectrum 
to smaller carriers serving rural areas.  This rulemaking builds on their proposal, which was featured in 
appropriations legislation from last year.  To this effort, I offer my full support.
I also offer my optimism.  That’s because at its core, universal service is the principle that no 
matter who you are or where you live you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 
21st century success.  This is a sacred responsibility under the law.  But we all know that the tools this 
agency is using have not been sufficient to get the job done.  Millions of Americans still lack access to 
affordable broadband, especially in rural communities.  So it’s a positive step that through this proceeding 
we evolve our thinking about universal service and recognize that spectrum policy tools can help bring 
advanced communication to remote areas.  
Now here’s the next step we should take if we want to be successful.  The partitioning, 
disaggregation, and leasing contemplated here will work better if our secondary markets can operate with 
full information.  Today, the place to go for information about who owns spectrum and who might sell or 
lease it is our Universal Licensing System.  But this database is opaque.  It’s not user friendly.  Moreover, 
it will only grow more complex and harder to use as we divide and divvy up licenses as contemplated 
here.  So I believe as we move forward with this proceeding, we need in parallel a proceeding that will 
improve this database and increase the transparency of spectrum ownership.  I hope my colleagues 
agree—and I look forward to making it happen.

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
Two weeks ago, on my first visit outside the beltway as an FCC Commissioner, I traveled to 
Kansas City, Missouri, along with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, who represents Missouri’s Fifth 
District.  We were eager to learn more about the work being done on the ground to help close the digital 
divide in Kansas City and how we, in Washington, could help facilitate, support and amplify those 
efforts. 
Among many stops, I attended a meeting of the Kansas City Coalition for Digital Inclusion, a 
group formed for the singular purpose of addressing the digital divide in Kansas City.  Comprised of 
representatives from area nonprofits, government entities, and businesses, as well as individuals, the 
group is “focused on fostering internet access and digital readiness in greater Kansas City.”  Missouri 
ranks 41st in the U.S. in connectivity and internet access, so it is abundantly clear that when it comes to 
ensuring every American can benefit from the transformative power of robust and affordable broadband, 
we have our work cut out for us, in Missouri and across the nation.
To that end, I welcome any and all ideas that show promise in helping us bridge the digital divide.  
I am pleased to support today’s item, which fulfills Congress’ directive in the MOBILE NOW Act and 
explores how potential changes to the Commission’s partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules would 
increase small carriers’ access to spectrum, expand the availability of broadband in rural areas, and 
advance our collective goal of closing the digital divide.  I look forward to reviewing the record that 
develops in this proceeding and challenge stakeholders to put forward their best and most innovative 
ideas.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. As part of the Commission’s continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to increase 
spectrum access by small and rural carriers, the Commission adopts this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
exploring how potential changes to our partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules might better serve 
those goals.  The Notice also satisfies the requirement under the Making Opportunities for Broadband 
Investment and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act),1 
which includes provisions requiring that the Commission take various actions concerning licensing, 
infrastructure, and deployment of wireless broadband services.  Among the provisions is a requirement 
that the Commission initiate a rulemaking to consider specific questions related to the partitioning or 
disaggregation of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access by small carriers.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Existing Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Spectrum Leasing Rules
2.Partitioning and Disaggregation.  Since its seminal 1996 CMRS Partitioning and 
Disaggregation Order,2 which adopted rules to permit geographic partitioning and spectrum 
disaggregation for Broadband PCS licenses, the Commission has adopted partitioning and disaggregation 
rules on a service-by-service basis as part of its long-held goal to provide licensees the “flexibility to 
determine the amount of spectrum they will occupy and the geographic area they will serve.”3  The 
1 MOBILE NOW Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Division P, Title VI, § 601 et seq. (2018).  The MOBILE NOW Act 
became law on March 23, 2018.

2Commission continues to allow partitioning and disaggregation of licenses for all services categorized as 
Wireless Radio Services.4
3. The Commission’s partitioning and disaggregation rules apply to all “Covered 
Geographic Licenses,” which are defined to consist of specified wireless radio services for which the 
Commission has auctioned exclusive spectrum rights in defined geographic areas.5  Under these existing 
Commission rules, “geographic partitioning” is the assignment of a geographic portion of a geographic 
area licensee’s license area.6  “Spectrum disaggregation” is the assignment of portions of blocks of a 
geographic area licensee’s spectrum.7
4. Covered geographic area licensees currently may seek Commission approval for 
partitioning, disaggregation, or a combination of both, by filing FCC Form 603 as part of an application 
for a partial assignment of authorization, pursuant to section 1.948 of the Commission’s rules.8  The 
license term for a partitioned license area or disaggregated spectrum license is the remainder of the 
original licensee’s license term.9  Parties to a geographic partitioning, a spectrum disaggregation, or a 
combination of both have two options to satisfy service-specific performance requirements (i.e., 
construction and operation requirements).10  First, each party may certify that it will individually satisfy 
any service-specific requirements and, upon failure to do so, must individually face any service-specific 
performance penalties.  Alternatively, both parties may agree to share responsibility for any service-
specific requirements, and in the event of a failure to meet their shared service-specific performance 
requirements, both parties are subject to any service-specific penalties.
5. The Commission has received over 1,000 assignment applications involving partitioning 
and disaggregation pertaining to more than 4,000 licenses over the last 10 years.  These have included 
assignment applications in which larger providers assigned spectrum to smaller entities.11
6.Spectrum Leasing.  In 2003, the Commission adopted the first comprehensive set of rules 
to allow licensees in the Wireless Radio Services to enter into a variety of spectrum leasing

3arrangements.12  In doing so, the Commission recognized the public interest benefits of permitting 
“additional spectrum users to gain ready access to spectrum,” thus enabling the “provision of new and 
diverse services and applications to help meet the ever-changing needs of the public.”13  Today, Subpart X 
of the Commission’s Part 1 rules establishes the requirements and procedures for spectrum leasing 
arrangements between licensees in the Wireless Radio Services.14
7. The Commission’s spectrum leasing rules apply to all “included services.”  These 
services are listed in section 1.9005 of the Commission’s rules and include Wireless Radio Services in 
which commercial or private licensees hold exclusive use rights.15  A “spectrum leasing arrangement” is 
an arrangement between a licensed entity and a third-party entity in which the licensee (spectrum lessor) 
leases certain of its spectrum usage rights in the licensed spectrum to the third-party entity, the spectrum 
lessee.16  The arrangement may involve the leasing of any amount of licensed spectrum, in any geographic 
area or site encompassed by the license, for any period of time during the term of the license 
authorization.  There are two different types of permissible spectrum leasing arrangements:  spectrum 
manager leasing arrangements and de facto transfer leasing arrangements.
8. A spectrum manager leasing arrangement is one in which the licensee/lessor retains de 
facto control of the licensed spectrum that it leases to the spectrum lessee.17  A licensee/lessor is deemed 
to have de facto control over the leased spectrum if it satisfies two conditions:  (i) the licensee/lessor 
retains responsibility for lessee compliance with Commission policy and rules; and (ii) the licensee/lessor 
retains responsibility for interactions with the Commission, including all filings, required under the 
license authorization and applicable service rules directly related to the leased spectrum.18  Subject to 
certain restrictions, spectrum manager leasing arrangements do not require prior Commission approval; 
rather, such arrangements are subject to certain notification requirements whereby the licensee/lessor 
must submit notice to the Commission of the arrangement in advance of commencing operations.19  While 
the licensee/lessor remains responsible for compliance with any construction and performance 
requirements applicable to the leased spectrum, the licensee/lessor may attribute to itself the build-out or 
(Continued from previous page)  
and Party B holding 15 megahertz over the entire EA.  We note that parties can also disaggregate and partition in 
combination, such as where Party A holds 30 megahertz of spectrum in an EA and assigns 5 megahertz in County X 
to Party B, resulting in Party A holding 25 megahertz in County X and 30 megahertz elsewhere in the EA, and Party 
B holding 5 megahertz only in County X.

4performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such requirements.20
9. A de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangement is an arrangement in which the 
licensee/lessor is generally relieved of the responsibility for ensuring that the spectrum lessee’s operations 
comply with the Communications Act and Commission policies and rules.21  De facto transfer spectrum 
leasing arrangements can be either long-term (more than one year)22 or short-term (one year or less).23  In 
general, de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangements are subject to the Commission’s general 
approval procedures, under which the licensee/lessor and proposed lessee must file an FCC Form 608, 
and the Commission must grant the application prior to the parties’ putting the proposed spectrum leasing 
arrangement into effect.24  Both long-term and short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing applications 
are subject to overnight processing under the Commission’s immediate approval procedures if the filing 
meets certain conditions.25  If a long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing application is not granted 
under the immediate approval procedures, the application is placed on an accepted for filing public notice 
(usually for 14 days) before the Commission may act on the filing.  Short-term de facto transfer spectrum 
leasing applications do not require advance public notice prior to Commission action.  A licensee/lessor 
that enters into a long-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing arrangement may attribute to itself the 
buildout or performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such 
requirements; a licensee/lessor may not do so under a short-term de facto transfer spectrum leasing 
arrangement.26
10. The Commission has received more than 8,000 spectrum lease applications and 
notifications pertaining to approximately 26,000 licenses over the last 10 years.
B. Statutory Requirement
11. Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act requires that, within a year of its enactment, the 
Commission: 
[I]nitiate a rulemaking proceeding to assess whether to establish a program, or modify existing 
programs, under which a licensee that receives a license for exclusive use of spectrum in a 
specific geographic area under section 301 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301) 
may partition or disaggregate the license by sale or long-term lease-

19 Id. § 1.9020(e) (requiring 21 days advance notice for spectrum manager leasing arrangements greater than one 
year in length, or 10 days advance notice for arrangements of one year or less in length).  The Commission reviews 
the notifications to ensure that all necessary technical and other information is correctly submitted, but the subject 
spectrum leasing arrangement may be implemented without waiting for such review, unless the parties to the 
spectrum manager leasing arrangement have requested on the form that the arrangement become effective upon 
Commission acceptance of the notification.  Spectrum manager leasing applications require no prior public notice 
before the Commission may accept them.

5(A) in order to-
(i) provide services consistent with the license; and 
(ii) make unused spectrum available to-
(I) an unaffiliated covered small carrier; or (II) an unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural 
area; and
(B) if the Commission finds that such a program would promote- (i) the availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas; or (ii) spectrum availability for covered 
small carriers.27
12. Section 616 requires the Commission to consider four questions in conducting the 
rulemaking.  First, would “reduced performance requirements with respect to the spectrum obtained 
through the program . . . facilitate deployment of advanced telecommunications services in areas covered 
by the program”?28  Second, “what conditions may be needed on transfers of spectrum under the program 
to allow covered small carriers that obtain spectrum under the program to build out the spectrum obtained 
under the program in a reasonable period of time”?29  Third, “what incentives may be appropriate to 
encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum, including (i) extending the term of a license . . . or (ii) 
modifying performance requirements of the license relating to the leased or sold spectrum”?30  And 
fourth, what is “the administrative feasibility” of those incentives and of “other incentives considered by 
the Commission that further the goals of [Section 616]”?31  Section 616 provides, however, that the 
Commission “may offer a licensee incentives or reduced performance requirements under this section 
only if the Commission finds that doing so would likely result in increased availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in a rural area.”32  Additionally, Section 616 directs that, “[i]f a party fails to 
meet any build out requirements set by the Commission for any spectrum sold or leased under this 
section, the right to the spectrum shall be forfeited to the Commission unless the Commission finds that 
there is good cause for the failure of the party.”33
13. In establishing its dual goals of making spectrum available to small carriers and 
promoting the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas, Section 616 defines 
two key terms.  “Covered small carrier” is a carrier34 that “(A) has not more than 1,500 employees (as 
determined under section 121.106 of title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto); and 
(B) offers services using the facilities of the carrier.”35  And “rural area” is any area other than “(A) a city,

31 Id. § 616(b)(2)(D).
32 Id. § 616(b)(4).
33 Id. § 616(b)(3).
34 Section 616 directs the Commission to use the definition of “carrier” contained in section 3 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, which defines a carrier as “any person engaged as a common carrier for hire, in 
interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy . . . but a 
person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier.”

6town, or incorporated area that has a population of more than 20,000 inhabitants; or (B) an urbanized area 
contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of more than 50,000 inhabitants.”36
III. DISCUSSION
14. The Commission’s existing partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules are designed to 
facilitate spectrum access and encourage secondary market transactions that will lead to efficient use of 
spectrum.  Today, we seek comment on whether to establish a program, or modify existing programs, for 
the partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing of licenses.  We also seek comment on what, if any, changes 
would promote the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum 
availability for covered small carriers—such as allowing additional time to meet performance obligations 
under certain circumstances.  We also ask commenters to address three considerations set forth in Section 
616, including addressing the administrative feasibility of each consideration; they are:  (1) whether 
reduced performance requirements applicable to partitioned or disaggregated licenses would promote the 
availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum availability for covered 
small carriers; (2) what conditions may be needed to eliminate impediments to transfers of spectrum to 
covered small carriers to allow them to build out in a reasonable period of time; and (3) what incentives 
may encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that 
will serve rural areas.  We seek to develop a record on the success of the Commission’s existing rules and 
therefore seek comment on whether further Commission action would likely promote the availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and facilitate access to spectrum by covered small 
carriers.
A. Reduced Performance Requirements In Rural Areas
15. We seek comment on whether reduced performance requirements for partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses would facilitate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services in rural 
areas.  The Commission’s rules permit parties to a partition or disaggregation to agree either to share the 
responsibility for meeting performance requirements or to satisfy the requirements individually.  We seek 
comment on potential modifications to these requirements that may be likely to increase service to rural 
areas, and on how to ensure that reduced performance requirements do not lead to reduced service in rural 
areas.
16. The Commission could adjust the performance requirements applicable to partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses either substantively (e.g., through reduced buildout requirements) or temporally 
(e.g., by extending deadlines for performance).  We seek comment on what, if any, such adjustments may 
be appropriate in this context.  Would the reduced performance requirements apply to the original 
licensee, the entity gaining access to the spectrum, or both?  Would a reduced buildout requirement in 
rural areas promote deployment in those areas, which might otherwise go unserved?  If so, how?  Would 
an extended deadline for performance increase a licensee’s ability and likelihood to provide service in 
rural areas?  How would the Commission ensure that any reduction in performance requirements results 
in increased rural area deployment?  Would the Commission have to pair reduced performance 
requirements with increased oversight, and subsequently increased penalties if these performance 
requirements are not met?  Is there a minimum set of performance requirements that are necessary to 
ensure adequate buildout?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to rural areas 
under differing levels of potential performance requirements?

"under differing levels of potential performance requirements?
17. With respect to our goal of promoting advanced telecommunications service in rural 
areas, we seek comment on whether, for example, to extend by one year a receiving party’s construction 
deadline for a partitioned or disaggregated license when (i) the receiving party is a rural carrier or is 
acquiring spectrum that includes “rural areas,” as defined by Section 616, and (ii) the receiving party 
elects to meet the construction requirement independently for its partitioned or disaggregated license area.

"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
7Under this scenario, to receive the one-year extension, should the party receiving the spectrum provide 
service to a certain percentage of the “rural areas” within its license area, such as 25 percent?  Is 25 
percent the appropriate metric to qualify for any rural area service extension, or should the percentage be 
higher, lower, or dependent upon some other factor, such as the size of the receiving party’s license area?  
Should the receiving party’s license area contain some minimum amount of “rural area” to qualify for the 
one-year extension?  We seek to facilitate transactions that will promote rural deployment by providing 
relief that will substantially benefit licensees.  As parties may not need construction relief early in a ten-
year license term, should we only apply an extension to transactions occurring within a certain timeframe, 
for example, no sooner than three years from the construction deadline?  Conversely, our rules provide 
that extension requests will not be granted for failure to meet a construction or coverage deadline because 
the licensee undergoes a transfer of control or because the licensee intends to assign the authorization.37  
To prevent filing a transaction and extension request late in the construction period to avoid loss of 
license, should we limit any one-year construction extension to requests filed no later than six months 
before the construction deadline, or some other appropriate timeframe?
18. Should the one-year extension apply to interim construction requirements, final 
requirements, or both?  For a license that receives a one-year extension for its final performance 
requirement, should the Commission also extend by one year the license term where the final construction 
deadline is coincident with renewal?  If not, what would be the effect of the extension on the license’s 
required renewal showing?  Similarly, what would be the effect of the extension on the license’s 
continuity of service obligations?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to rural 
areas with and without a one-year extension?  What would be the costs and benefits to delaying 
construction in rural areas?  How would we compare the cost of the potential short-term delay in 
construction to the potential long-term benefit of an increase in service to rural areas?
19. Commenters advocating for these specific approaches, or for other approaches involving 
reduced performance requirements, should discuss how they would be implemented, including how and 
when they would take effect, to whom they would apply, and any specific conditions that should apply.  
Commenters should also describe in detail how any such implementation would serve to promote the 
availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas.  Further, in light of Section 616’s 
requirement that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of implementing reduced 
performance requirements, commenters should discuss the costs and benefits of any proposed 
implementation.  How would these costs and benefits be measured?
B. Conditions on Transfers of Spectrum to Covered Small Carriers
20. As a threshold matter, the MOBILE NOW Act directs the Commission to focus on 
programs that would promote spectrum availability for “covered small carriers,” a term that as noted 
above encompasses only common carriers.38  While we seek comment below on issues relating to 
“covered small carriers,” as required, we also seek comment on whether we should consider applying any 
rule revisions to an expanded class of licensees beyond those Congress requires us to consider.  Would 
expanding the rule revisions serve the purposes of the MOBILE NOW Act, including the purpose of 
promoting “the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas”?  If commenters 
believe the Section 616 definition of “covered small carrier” is under-inclusive,39 they should describe",6,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

8what category or categories of licensee should be subject to any Commission rule change, the effects of 
applying any rule changes to entities that are not common carriers, how the Commission should adjust our 
rules to better meet our goals in this proceeding of facilitating secondary markets transactions, and the 
costs and benefits of such an approach.
21. We seek comment on what conditions may be needed on transfers of spectrum to allow 
covered small carriers to build out in a reasonable period.  We seek comment on whether there are 
procedural barriers to partitioning or disaggregation that limit the utility of those programs for covered 
small carriers.  Are there certain parties that are currently foreclosed from partitioning, disaggregating, or 
leasing spectrum due to such barriers, that might otherwise make use of the existing programs in the 
absence of those barriers?  If so, we seek comment on the nature of those barriers and the types of entities 
that are currently foreclosed.
22. In addition to procedural barriers to partitioning and disaggregation, we seek comment on 
whether there are substantive barriers with respect to covered small carriers’ ability to satisfy performance 
requirements applicable to the partitioned or disaggregated spectrum.  Do covered small carriers require 
reduced or modified performance requirements in order to successfully build out the spectrum obtained 
through such arrangements?  Would reduced construction obligations for an entire license area lead to 
increased construction or service for certain parts of that market?  Would extended performance deadlines 
increase the number of covered small carriers that are willing and able to obtain spectrum through 
partitioning, disaggregation, or lease arrangements?  How could the Commission ensure that a reduction 
in construction requirements does not lead to a reduction in services deployed?  Would the reduced 
obligations apply to the original licensee, the entity gaining access to the spectrum, or both?  For example, 
would a one-year construction requirement extension, akin to that discussed above with respect to 
transactions involving rural carriers, be appropriate for transfer of spectrum to covered small carriers?  
Commenters advocating any special conditions for covered small carriers should describe in detail the 
extent to which such conditions are necessary or likely to increase covered small carrier participation in 
the Commission’s existing or new partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing programs. 
23. As stated, the Commission has received more than 1,000 assignment applications 
involving partitioned or disaggregated licenses over the last 10 years, which included assignment 
applications in which larger providers assigned spectrum to smaller entities.  We seek comment on 
whether our current rules promote the efficient level of secondary market transactions.  What are the costs 
and benefits, if the rules were to be changed?
24. We seek comment on these and any other relevant considerations regarding special 
conditions for covered small carriers that obtain access to spectrum through partition or disaggregation.  
Commenters should discuss in detail both the necessity and the likelihood of any such conditions 
resulting in increased spectrum availability for covered small carriers.  Further, in light of the Section 616 
requirement that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of special conditions for covered 
small carriers, commenters should also discuss the costs and benefits of any conditions they advocate.  
What are the potential costs of modified performance requirements in terms of speed and quality of 
deployment?  What are the benefits in terms of increased coverage and quality of service, including in 
rural areas?  How would these costs and benefits be measured?

"rural areas?  How would these costs and benefits be measured?
C. Incentives To Encourage Lease or Sale
25. In light of Section 616’s requirement that we consider incentives that might encourage 
licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural 
areas, we seek comment on what, if any, incentives may be appropriate to achieve this end, including 
license term extensions or modified performance requirements.  Are there certain substantive or 
procedural barriers to leasing that inefficiently limit use of the program by spectrum licensees?  For 
example, where our spectrum leasing rules require Commission consent to an application prior to 
consummation, does the administrative burden of seeking such prior approval act to deter such 
transactions, and, if so, do such disincentives have a disproportionate effect on transactions with covered",7,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
9small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that seek to provide service to rural areas?  Would a longer license 
term or modified performance requirements be effective in counteracting those administrative burdens?
26. As stated, the Commission processed over 8,000 spectrum lease applications in the last 
10 years.  We seek comment on whether our existing secondary markets rules are sufficiently flexible to 
provide adequate incentives for licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights to covered small carriers or 
unaffiliated carriers that seek to provide service to rural areas.  For example, in addition to earning 
revenue from such transactions, licensees that enter into long-term leases may attribute the buildout and 
performance activities of the lessee for purposes of satisfying the licensee’s own performance 
obligations.40  Are such incentives sufficient to encourage licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights to 
such carriers?  We seek comment on the effectiveness of existing benefits of sale or lease, and whether 
further incentives would be likely to encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum.
27. We seek comment on whether and how modified performance requirements or longer 
license terms might encourage more licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights.  Commenters should 
discuss the incremental benefits of increasing the number of spectrum sales or leases relative to the 
potential collateral effects that such incentives may have.  For example, while reduced buildout 
requirements may increase the number of licensees willing to lease spectrum, it may also decrease 
deployment of advanced wireless services in those license areas as a result of the reduced performance 
requirements.  We therefore seek comment on the specific costs and benefits of any incentives that 
commenters advocate and the relative weight the Commission should apply in evaluating whether those 
incentives would be likely to result in increased availability of advanced telecommunications services in 
rural areas.  Would the Commission have to pair reduced performance requirements with increased 
oversight, and subsequently increased penalties if these performance requirements are not met?  Is there a 
minimum set of performance requirements that are necessary to ensure adequate buildout?  In cases 
where the party receiving the spectrum is an unaffiliated carrier that will serve rural areas, how can we 
ensure adequate buildout to rural areas?  How would the Commission measure the change in service to 
rural areas under differing levels of potential performance requirements?
28. We also seek comment on whether allowing spectrum “reaggregation” for spectrum that 
has been partitioned or disaggregated on the secondary market—up to the size of the original market 
area—would increase the incentives of parties to lease or sell spectrum in the first place, and thus 
ultimately meet the dual goals of increasing the availability of advanced telecommunications services in 
rural areas and facilitating access to spectrum by covered small carriers.  Under our current rules, while 
licensees may partition and disaggregate their licenses through spectrum transactions, there is no 
provision for reaggregating spectrum, even when the partitioned or disaggregated portions of an original 
market area are acquired by a single entity.  Holding multiple licenses for what was once a single license 
may impose certain regulatory and administrative burdens on licensees, including construction 
requirements, renewal showings, continuous service requirements, and the need to maintain up-to-date 
information in ULS.  In the context of other proceedings, some parties have asked the Commission to 
allow reaggregation of spectrum to ease these burdens.41  We seek comment on the relationship between 
reducing these burdens and incentivizing spectrum transactions.",8,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"allow reaggregation of spectrum to ease these burdens.41  We seek comment on the relationship between 
reducing these burdens and incentivizing spectrum transactions.
29. One potential disadvantage of allowing reaggregation is that carriers may attempt to use 
it to avoid construction requirements.  Should we only permit spectrum reaggregation where the licensee 
has already met its construction obligations with respect to the reaggregated spectrum?  Should other 
conditions apply before reaggregation is allowed to ensure that construction requirements for both areas 
40 However, in a spectrum manager lease of any length term, the licensee may attribute to itself the build-out or 
performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such requirements.  See 47 CFR 
§ 1.9020(d)(5).
41 See, e.g., Sprint Comments, WT Docket No. 10-112, at 19-20 (filed Aug. 6, 2010); AT&T Reply Comments, WT 
Docket No. 10-112, at 12 (filed Aug. 23, 2010).",8,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Federal Communications Commission FCC 19-22
10of the reaggregated spectrum are met?  Or should the Commission allow the licensee of the reaggregated 
spectrum to meet the performance requirements of the original market area?  What filings and/or 
showings could we require the licensee to make to expedite Commission review of construction 
obligations in reaggregated spectrum?  If spectrum reaggregation were allowed, what safeguards should 
the Commission put in place to prevent entities from using the process as a way of “laundering” their 
regulatory obligations?
30. Should the Commission require that licensees meet renewal requirements and continuity 
of service obligations with respect to the reaggregated spectrum?  If so, what measures could the 
Commission put in place to ensure that licensees comply with these requirements?  What filings and/or 
showings could we require the licensee to make to expedite Commission review?  Again, we seek 
comment on what safeguards the Commission should put in place to ensure that licensees potentially 
permitted to reaggregate their licenses meet regulatory obligations with respect to renewal and continuity 
of service.  Would the Commission have to pair reaggregation with increased oversight, and subsequently 
increased penalties if certain buildout thresholds are not met?  How would the Commission measure the 
change in service to rural areas with and without spectrum reaggregation?  Would there be a chance that a 
reaggregated license would cause a barrier to entry for other providers, thereby potentially reducing 
buildout in rural areas?  What are the other costs and benefits that may be associated with reaggregation?  
We note that legal, policy, and technical review—and adjustments to license and map files—would be 
required in order for Commission staff to process what could be hundreds of reaggregation applications a 
year.  These filings would compete with the many other filings before Commission staff for their 
attention. 
31. If commenters advocate for incentives such as modified performance requirements, 
longer license terms, spectrum reaggregation, or another incentive, they should describe in detail how the 
incentive would likely increase the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or 
facilitate access to spectrum by covered small carriers.  Further, in light of the Section 616 requirement 
that the Commission consider the administrative feasibility of providing incentives to lease or sell 
spectrum, commenters should also discuss the costs and benefits of any incentives they advocate.  How 
would these costs and benefits be measured?

13APPENDIX
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in this 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice).  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.  
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments 
on the Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or 
summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2.As part of the Commission’s continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to increase 
spectrum access by small and rural carriers, the Commission adopts this Notice exploring how potential 
changes to our partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules might better serve those goals.  The Notice 
also satisfies the Commission’s requirement under the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment 
and Limiting Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (MOBILE NOW Act),4 which includes 
provisions requiring that the Commission take various actions concerning licensing, infrastructure, and 
deployment of wireless broadband services.  Among those provisions is a requirement that the 
Commission initiate a rulemaking to consider specific questions related to partitioning or disaggregation 
of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access by covered small carriers.
B. Legal Basis
3. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 303, and 310(d) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i), 303, 310(d), and Pub. L. No. 115-141, Div. P, 
Title VI, § 616, 132 Stat. 348.
C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
4. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.5  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”6  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.7  A small business

operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.8
5.Small Businesses, Small Organizations, and Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our 
action may, over time, affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore 
describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.9  
First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory 
flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is 
an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.10  These types of small businesses represent 
99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 28.8 million businesses.11
6. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”12  
Nationwide, as of August 2016, there were approximately 356,494 small organizations based on 
registration and tax data filed by nonprofits with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).13
7. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”14  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 Census 
of Governments15 indicates that there were 90,056 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16  Of this number there were 
37,132 general purpose governments (county,17 municipal, and town or township18) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,184 special purpose governments (independent school districts19 and special 
districts20) with populations of less than 50,000.  The 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data for most types of 
governments in the local government category shows that the majority of these governments have 
populations of less than 50,000.21  Based on this data we estimate that at least 49,316 local government

publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

13 Data from the Urban Institute, National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) reporting on nonprofit 
organizations registered with the IRS was used to estimate the number of small organizations.  Reports generated 
using the NCCS online database indicated that as of August 2016 there were 356,494 registered nonprofits with total 
revenues of less than $100,000.  Of this number, 326,897 entities filed tax returns with 65,113 registered nonprofits 
reporting total revenues of $50,000 or less on the IRS Form 990-N for Small Exempt Organizations and 261,784 
nonprofits reporting total revenues of $100,000 or less on some other version of the IRS Form 990 within 24 months

15jurisdictions fall in the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”22
8.Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.23  The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small 
if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.24  For this industry, U.S. Census data for 2012 show that there were 
967 firms that operated for the entire year.25  Of this total, 955 firms had employment of 999 or fewer 
employees and 12 had employment of 1,000 employees or more.26  Thus, under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications 
carriers (except satellite) are small entities.
9. The Commission has determined from data available in its Universal Licensing System 
that there are approximately 1,095 unique licensees corresponding to more than 40,000 licenses in the 
Wireless Radio Services that could be affected by this Notice, as of February 21, 2019.27  The

D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities
10. The proposed actions in the Notice, if adopted, may impose reporting, recordkeeping and 
other compliance requirements on small entities as well as other licensees.  For example, there are 
potential changes to performance requirements that could alter existing, or create additional, 
recordkeeping and compliance obligations for small entities as well as other licensees.  Specifically, the 
Notice seeks comment on whether to reduce performance requirements for partitioned or disaggregated 
licenses to facilitate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and access to 
spectrum by covered small carriers.  The Notice also asks whether the Commission would have to pair 
reduced performance requirements with increased oversight, and whether reduced performance 
requirements would apply to the licensee, the entity gaining access to spectrum, or both.  The Notice 
directs commenters advocating for reduced performance requirements to discuss how they would apply 
and be implemented, any specific conditions that would apply, how and when they would take effect, and 
the costs and benefits of any proposed implementation, including how the costs and benefits should be 
measured.
11. To advance the Commission’s goal of promoting advanced telecommunications service 
in rural areas, the Notice explores whether there should be changes to construction deadlines and how any

17modified deadlines should be applied.  In this regard, the Notice seeks comment on whether to extend by 
one year the performance requirement deadline for a party receiving partitioned or disaggregated 
spectrum if certain conditions are met, including that the license is partitioned or disaggregated to a rural 
carrier or includes a certain amount of “rural areas,” as defined by Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW 
Act, and the party receiving the spectrum independently meets the construction requirements.  The Notice 
asks whether a similar extension should apply with respect to transactions involving “covered small 
carriers,” as defined by Section 616.  Recognizing that the MOBILE NOW Act’s definition of “covered 
small carriers” encompasses only common carriers, the Notice seeks comment on whether the 
Commission should consider applying any rule revisions stemming from this proceeding to an expanded 
class of licensees beyond those Congress requires it to consider, and the effects of any rule changes to 
entities that are not common carriers.  If the Commission were to adopt this type of one-year extension of 
performance requirement deadlines, it could also potentially impact both renewal and continuity of 
service obligations for licensees.  The Notice asks what the effect of the extension would be on these 
obligations, and asks whether the license term should also be extended where a receiving party’s final 
construction deadline is coincident with renewal.
12.Spectrum Transfers.  The Notice asks what, if any, rule changes may be necessary 
relating to transfers of spectrum to allow covered small carriers to obtain spectrum through partitioning, 
disaggregation, or lease arrangements.  In particular, the Notice seeks comment on whether reduced or 
modified performance requirements or extended performance deadlines would aid and increase the 
successful build out by covered small carriers who obtain spectrum through partitioning, disaggregation, 
or lease arrangements.  Further, in light of Section 616’s requirement that the Commission consider the 
administrative feasibility of special conditions for covered small carriers, the Notice seeks comment on 
the costs and benefits of any proposed changes or conditions.
13.Incentives to Encourage Lease or Sale.  In light of Section 616’s requirement that the 
Commission consider incentives that might encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small 
carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural areas, the Notice seeks comment on what, if any, 
incentives may be appropriate to meet this objective, and how these potential incentives may impact the 
recordkeeping and compliance obligations of covered small carriers.  In particular, the Notice seeks 
comment on whether and how modified performance requirements or longer license terms might 
encourage more licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights; specific costs and benefits of any 
incentives; whether to pair reduced performance requirements with increased oversight; whether a 
minimum set of performance requirements would be necessary to ensure adequate buildout; and whether 
there should be increased penalties if performance requirements are not met.  Additionally, the Notice 
seeks comment on whether allowing spectrum “reaggregation” for spectrum that has been partitioned or 
disaggregated on the secondary market—up to the size of the original market area—would help 
incentivize more parties to lease or sell spectrum.  If spectrum reaggregation were allowed, the Notice 
asks what safeguards the Commission should put in place to prevent entities from using the process as a 
way of “laundering” their regulatory obligations.  It also asks whether the Commission should require that 
licensees meet renewal requirements and continuity of service obligations with respect to the",16,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"licensees meet renewal requirements and continuity of service obligations with respect to the 
reaggregated spectrum, and if so, what measures the Commission should put in place to ensure that 
licensees comply with these requirements.  The Notice further asks what filings and/or showings the 
licensee could be required to make to expedite Commission review.
14. While the Commission is not currently in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the 
potential rule changes that could result from questions raised in the Notice will require small entities to 
hire attorneys, engineers, consultants, or other professionals, and cannot quantify the cost of compliance 
with the potential rule changes that could be adopted, it does not believe that the costs and/or 
administrative burdens associated with any of the potential rule changes will unduly burden small entities.  
In the discussion of these potential rule changes, the Commission has sought comments from parties in 
the proceeding, including seeking cost and benefit analyses.  These may help the Commission identify 
and evaluate other relevant matters, including compliance costs and burdens on small entities that may 
result from the matters explored in the Notice.",16,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

18E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
15. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, 
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following 
four alternatives (among others):  “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the 
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for 
small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from 
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof for small entities.”28
16. In the Notice, the Commission has raised alternatives to facilitate changes that would 
promote the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum availability 
for covered small carriers—such as allowing additional time to meet performance obligations under 
certain circumstances.  The Commission has also sought to identify and target for removal procedural and 
substantive barriers impacting covered small carriers relating to partitioning, disaggregating, or leasing 
spectrum. In addition, the Commission has raised questions to address what conditions may be needed to 
eliminate impediments to transfers of spectrum to covered small carriers to allow them to build out in a 
reasonable period of time, and identify what incentives may encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum 
to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural areas.
17. The Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small entities 
following its review of comments filed in response to the Notice, including costs and benefits analyses, 
and this IFRA.  The Commission’s evaluation of the comments filed in this proceeding will shape the 
final conclusions it reaches, the final alternatives it considers, and the actions it ultimately takes in this 
proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities.

CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
The recent Netflix series, “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,” has launched a phenomenon as 
Americans embrace Marie’s special way of keeping a tidy home.  A key to the KonMari method is 
effectively managing your possessions by keeping only those that “spark joy.”  For the FCC, spectrum 
that is being put to productive use sparks joy.  Spectrum that lies fallow does not.  That’s why we allow 
license holders to partition, disaggregate, or lease spectrum so more of it can be more easily used.
To ensure we do that as effectively as possible, today’s Notice tees up many questions regarding 
the Commission’s partitioning and disaggregation rules (which allow a spectrum license to be broken up 
into smaller pieces), as well as our leasing rules.  We’re aiming to figure out whether any changes to 
those rules would help small carriers and wireless Internet service providers get better access to spectrum, 
such as by encouraging spectrum licensees to lease or sell spectrum to small companies serving rural 
areas.  Additionally, in order to fulfill our obligations under the MOBILE NOW Act, we seek comment 
on whether a change to performance requirements could help rural telecommunications services and 
smaller providers.  And we’re also looking at how reaggregating previously separated licenses might 
encourage deployment of additional services.  In short, we want to explore ways to improve wireless 
access in parts of this country—and I’ve seen many of them—that too often are on the wrong side of the 
digital divide.  I’m looking forward to reviewing the record on these questions to find the appropriate way 
forward.  And I do hope it sparks joy, of course.

20STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER MICHAEL O’RIELLY
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
I approve today’s notice seeking input on how the Commission’s secondary market policies can 
increase deployment in rural areas and facilitate the ability of small wireless providers to access spectrum.  
Congress required that we conduct – and I wholeheartedly support – such a review. 
By way of background, the Commission has policies in place to facilitate secondary market 
transactions.  Licenses can be sold or leased, in whole or in part, with overnight approval for many of the 
applications and notices for such deals.  In fact, the Commission has conducted similar reviews in the 
past, which resulted in the introduction of leasing and expedited processing where appropriate.  While the 
Commission has streamlined its procedures and provided flexibility under our rules to facilitate deals in 
rural America and to get spectrum into the hands of small businesses, many still assert that a vibrant 
secondary market, involving rural and small entities, has not developed.
 
The most common obstacle involves the simple fact that, often, it just isn’t worth a current 
licensee’s time to consider a small deal.  Basically, the cost of negotiations and paperwork can outweigh 
the economic gains for spectrum in a more remote area.  Therefore, our conversation must focus on how 
to reduce such burdens so that those with some excess spectrum in less populated areas are willing to 
enter into transactions.  Not an easy task, I admit. 
While the notice offers some ideas, they are far from likely to open the secondary market 
floodgates.  I am somewhat skeptical that reducing performance requirements, providing some additional 
time for construction, or extending the license terms for operators that lease or sell spectrum will make a 
substantial difference.  Regardless, I am more than happy to engage with interested parties on any of these 
ideas and others that they may have.  
Ultimately, I hope industry will take this opportunity to think out of the box about ways – 
including approaches requiring Commission action or industry best practices – to meaningfully lower 
transaction costs and time spent so that those with spectrum are truly incentivized to execute the requisite 
deals.  One way to reduce costs and hasten deal making could be to create a database or exchange that 
contains operator-approved contracts and available spectrum – an operational template, if you will.  If an 
entity is willing to accept a contract as is, it could be submitted to the operator electronically, reducing 
prolonged back-and-forth negotiations and the requisite legal work.  But, I recognize that it will likely 
take some greater effort to get license holders to participate and use advanced technologies that can 
inherently automate, record, and execute deals without emotion or competitive concerns and that hold 
interesting possibilities.  
I thank the Chairman and Congress for starting this important discussion, but this proceeding will 
only be as good as the thought that goes into it.  I hope wireless providers – big and small, urban and rural 
– really take the time to consider this issue and provide creative solutions.",19,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

COMMISSIONER BRENDAN CARR
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
A few months ago, I had the chance to meet Whitney from Lambert, Montana.  Her family runs a 
farming and ranching operation in the northeast corner of Big Sky Country.  The area is famous for being 
the farthest place in the country from a Starbucks.  It’s about 190 miles to the closest green-aproned 
barista.  A run to the grocery store is a 100-mile drive round trip.  The nearest big city, Billings, is five 
and a half hours away.  
Yet Whitney is an Instagram star.  She makes money by using her smartphone to produce and 
upload what have become viral videos.  She calls one of her more famous videos “CrossFit for Cows,”29 
and it’s been viewed millions of times.  It shows Ghost, one of her 1,200 pound Herefords, rolling a straw 
bale across a snow-covered field.  Whitney can get 4G LTE when she’s in the field because there’s a cell 
tower not far away that was put up to cover a highway that runs through the area.  But there are still too 
many people in rural America that can’t get a 4G LTE signal.
And that is why the FCC is working on a number of fronts to help close this digital divide.  We 
have allocated up to $4.5 billion to bring 4G LTE to more Americans.  We have streamlined broadband 
infrastructure rules.  And we have sought comment on expanding the FCC’s existing geographic coverage 
requirements.30
Today, we tee up another option for increasing wireless service in rural America.  As required by 
Congress in the MOBILE NOW Act, we seek comment on how our spectrum leasing and related rules 
can help promote wireless deployment in areas that might otherwise go unserved.
Now, everyone may not have the same social media skills as Whitney, but they should at least 
have the same opportunity at next-gen connectivity.  So I support today’s Notice, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on these important issues.

COMMISSIONER JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
In 2015, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Fischer introduced bipartisan legislation to improve 
universal service by extending the reach of wireless broadband in rural communities.  They proposed to 
do this by providing incentives for wireless carriers to partition, disaggregate, and lease unused spectrum 
to smaller carriers serving rural areas.  This rulemaking builds on their proposal, which was featured in 
appropriations legislation from last year.  To this effort, I offer my full support.
I also offer my optimism.  That’s because at its core, universal service is the principle that no 
matter who you are or where you live you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 
21st century success.  This is a sacred responsibility under the law.  But we all know that the tools this 
agency is using have not been sufficient to get the job done.  Millions of Americans still lack access to 
affordable broadband, especially in rural communities.  So it’s a positive step that through this proceeding 
we evolve our thinking about universal service and recognize that spectrum policy tools can help bring 
advanced communication to remote areas.  
Now here’s the next step we should take if we want to be successful.  The partitioning, 
disaggregation, and leasing contemplated here will work better if our secondary markets can operate with 
full information.  Today, the place to go for information about who owns spectrum and who might sell or 
lease it is our Universal Licensing System.  But this database is opaque.  It’s not user friendly.  Moreover, 
it will only grow more complex and harder to use as we divide and divvy up licenses as contemplated 
here.  So I believe as we move forward with this proceeding, we need in parallel a proceeding that will 
improve this database and increase the transparency of spectrum ownership.  I hope my colleagues 
agree—and I look forward to making it happen.",21,FCC-19-22A1.pdf,Commission documents,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
Two weeks ago, on my first visit outside the beltway as an FCC Commissioner, I traveled to 
Kansas City, Missouri, along with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, who represents Missouri’s Fifth 
District.  We were eager to learn more about the work being done on the ground to help close the digital 
divide in Kansas City and how we, in Washington, could help facilitate, support and amplify those 
efforts. 
Among many stops, I attended a meeting of the Kansas City Coalition for Digital Inclusion, a 
group formed for the singular purpose of addressing the digital divide in Kansas City.  Comprised of 
representatives from area nonprofits, government entities, and businesses, as well as individuals, the 
group is “focused on fostering internet access and digital readiness in greater Kansas City.”  Missouri 
ranks 41st in the U.S. in connectivity and internet access, so it is abundantly clear that when it comes to 
ensuring every American can benefit from the transformative power of robust and affordable broadband, 
we have our work cut out for us, in Missouri and across the nation.
To that end, I welcome any and all ideas that show promise in helping us bridge the digital divide.  
I am pleased to support today’s item, which fulfills Congress’ directive in the MOBILE NOW Act and 
explores how potential changes to the Commission’s partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules would 
increase small carriers’ access to spectrum, expand the availability of broadband in rural areas, and 
advance our collective goal of closing the digital divide.  I look forward to reviewing the record that 
develops in this proceeding and challenge stakeholders to put forward their best and most innovative 
ideas.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  
The Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (“DSA”)1 welcomes the Federal Communications 
Commission’s efforts to increase the availability of advanced telecommunications services in 
rural areas, facilitate access to spectrum by covered small carriers and enhance the efficacy of 
secondary spectrum ma rkets.2 As the Commission has previously observed, effective secondary 
markets can in theory be a tool to help alleviate spectrum shortages, encourage innovation, put 
spectrum to its highest and best use, and bridge the digital divide3--goals which DSA 
enthusiastically shares. As many parties including DSA have previously established, however, 
secondary markets have not historically been successful in achieving those goals. Rather, the 
evidence indicates that secondary markets have largely failed --whether d ue to high transaction 
costs, lack of incentives, or a combination of the two --when it comes to providing spectrum to 
smaller competitive or rural carriers, let alone innovative industrial, enterprise or institutional 
users. Alarmingly, as NCTA has observe d, secondary markets have in fact “proven to be an 
effective tool for large operators to consolidate  spectrum” rather than making spectrum available 
for non -carrier use cases.4 With these challenges in mind, two related innovations for which DSA

has long advocated can help achieve the goals of this proceeding: the “use -it-or-share -it” 
regulatory framework and dynamic database management.   
Use-it-or-share -it:  The traditional model of exclusive use of spectrum over large 
geographical areas for ext ended terms (e.g., ten years with an expectation of renewal) provides 
little incentive for licensees to make their spectrum available for smaller, rural or competitive use 
cases. In such circumstances, licensees may not want to take on the transaction cost s required to 
partition, disaggregate or sublease their license to a third party. More fundamentally, licensees 
may want to preserve optionality in the future to build out to less economically attractive areas, 
or even be motivated to stifle competition. T he result is underutilization of spectrum and 
warehousing, often at the expense of the underserved and rural communities . Adoption of use -it-
or-share -it rules would  encourage licensees to put their spectrum to use more quickly, or absent 
that, make unused spectrum available for  opportunistic uses or  lessees on the secondary market.   
Dynamic database management : Finding available spectrum, negotiating sublicensing 
arrangements, and overcoming bureaucratic hurdles are particularly time -consuming and costly 
endeavors for parties seeking access to licenses spectrum. Lowering these transaction costs is 
critical to creating robust and liquid secondary markets. The Commission should employ 
automated databases --similar to the soon -to-be-deployed Spectrum Access Sys tem (SAS) in the 
3.5GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band --that can be used to identify usable 
spectrum, maintain detailed network information, and coordinate between different users and 
priority rights. A new spectrum secondary market exchange could use the capabilities of 
databases like the SAS to facilitate and enact secondary market transactions.",3,DSA Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing of Spectrum - NPRM Comments (signed).pdf,DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

DISCUSSION  
I. Secondary Spectrum Markets Function Poorly.  
Carrier licensees often build out their networks to a small portion of a large license area, 
leaving a surplus of unused spectrum, usually in less densely populated areas. The Commission 
has acknowledged that adopting policies that favor licensing large areas for extended terms can 
lead to spectrum being underutilized, and that secon dary market transactions are means for 
licensees to meet market demand for their surplus spectrum.5 Indeed, the Commission has 
repeatedly acknowledged that secondary markets promote “efficient use of spectrum by enabling 
licensees to make offerings directl y responsive to market demands for particular types of 
services, increasing competition by allowing new entrants to enter markets, and expediting 
provision of services that might not otherwise be provided in the near term.”6   
Even with a surplus of spectr um and high demand for its use, however, real world 
evidence points to a poorly functioning secondary spectrum marketplace that achieves little in 
the way of making spectrum available to small, competitive, rural or innovative users. For 
instance, the Wire less Internet Service Providers Association (“WISPA”) surveyed members in 
2017 and found that 25 percent of survey respondents reported that they had attempted to obtain 
licensed spectrum from AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T -Mobile, but that less than ten perce nt of

those who had made those attempts were successful.7 WISPA’s survey is consistent with the 
Commission’s licensing records, which show that carriers that typically acquire large -area 
licenses at auction rarely engage in secondary market transactions wi th smaller competitive 
service providers.8  
II. High Transaction Costs Contribute to Poorly Functioning Secondary Markets.  
A significant contributing factor to the poor functioning of secondary spectrum markets is 
high transaction costs. Bureaucratic hurdles, inability for potential buyers to obtain information 
on available spectrum, administrative burdens on buyers and sellers, and complex and costly 
negotiations for secondary rights make the proposition of creating a robust marketplace 
difficult.9  
Moreover, as economist William Lehr has observed, these transaction costs fall  
disproportionately on smaller, competitive, or rural users who would have to “incur spectrum 
leasing costs that are likely to be higher for them than for a large national operator who is likely 
already to have an in -house team to manage spectrum transactions.”10 The upshot of these less -
than-ideal conditions for secondary markets is that spectrum is left underutilized and consumers

left underserved, particularly in rural areas where the asy mmetric impact of transaction costs on 
smaller providers can be particularly acute.  
III. A Use -it-or-Share -it Authorization Would Promote More Intensive Spectrum Use 
and Facilitate Secondary Market Transactions  
  As described above, permissive secondary market rules have failed to put an adequate 
share of unused spectrum to work in rural and other underserved areas that are less profitable for 
the holders of most exclusive, large -area licenses. Accordingly, DSA rec ommends that the 
Commission extend its use -it-or-share -it rules to a larger number of exclusively -licensed bands 
in order to promote more intensive use of the spectrum, as well as stronger incentives and 
mechanisms to encourage secondary market transaction s. Opportunistic access, coupled with 
strong protections for incumbent licensees, should be considered as a central part of any effort 
aimed at expanding both direct and secondary market access to unused spectrum by smaller and 
non-traditional ISPs, as wel l as for enterprise and institutional use, in rural and underserved 
areas.  
Conceptually, use -it-or-share -it rules authorize opportunistic access to licensed spectrum 
that is locally unused or underutilized, coupled with the assurance that users will not in terfere 
with licensees and will in fact vacate the spectrum as needed once the licensee commences 
service.  Until the spectrum is actually put into service in a local area it should be available for 
non-interfering use by networks and devices that are mult i-band and required to regularly 
Licensees lose no rights whatsoever and bear a de minimus  burden to simply inform the certified 
database coordinator prior to commencing service in a particular local area, so that any 
opportunistic users will be immediatel y denied permission to operate on that frequency band.",6,DSA Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing of Spectrum - NPRM Comments (signed).pdf,DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

Dynamic Spectrum Alliance Limited. Company no. 8736143 (England & Wales)   ●   admin@dynamicspectrumalliance.org  
This approach is far from unprecedented. Use -it-or-share -it rules have been adopted by 
the Commission in relation to two significant flexible -use bands in recent years: the post -auction 
600 MHz band an d the Priority Access License (PAL) spectrum at 3.5 GHz that will soon be 
auctioned. First, in 2014, the Commission’s Incentive Auction Report & Order authorized TV 
White Space devices (WSDs) to continue operating in the 600 MHz band post -auction until suc h 
time as the licensee gives notice that it will “commence operations” in that local area.11 The 
Commission recognized that temporary, opportunistic access to unused 600 MHz spectrum on a 
localized basis would encourage more intensive use of the band while doing no harm to licensees 
who would be ensured exclusive, non -interfering use of the spectrum thanks to the enforcing 
function of the automated TV Bands Database (TVDB).  The Commission expressed its 
confidence in the ability of an automated database to p rotect licensees: “Since TVWS devices 
can operate only on channels identified in the TV bands databases, these databases can serve to 
ensure that unlicensed operations will no longer occur on a channel on which a licensee has 
commenced service. When a 600 MHz Band licensee plans to commence operations . . . that 
licensee can notify any of the TV bands database administrators when and where it plans to 
commence operations.”12 
Building on this precedent, in 2016 the Commission again authorized opportunistic 
access (“General Authorized Access” or “GAA”) to unused Priority Access Licensed (“PAL”)

spectrum as part of the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).  In its Order on 
Reconsideration , the Commission stated: “We believe that the ‘use it or share it’ appro ach of our 
rules for this unique band also thus more reasonably accommodates the goals of Section 309(j) 
of the Act, including ‘to prevent stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum.’”13 Of course, like the 
600 MHz authorization, opportunistic use of unused PAL  spectrum is controlled by the Spectrum 
Access System, which requires that GAA users must periodically check with the database to 
renew permission to continue operating. As even some mobile carriers acknowledged in that 
proceeding,14 there is no risk of har mful interference or loss of usage rights to the licensee 
provided that permission for opportunistic GAA use is valid only until one of the SAS operators 
receives a notification that the licensee is ready to commence service in that local area.  
A general ‘ use it or share it’ authorization has a number of affirmative benefits that 
advance the goals of the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting 
Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (“MOBILE NOW Act”) and the 
Commission’s seconda ry market rules.  
First, opportunistic access reduces spectrum warehousing in areas where the economics 
are least attractive for large ISPs, particularly in rural and other less densely populated areas with 
low ARPU. A “use it or share it” approach creates a general incentive for licensees to build out

Dynamic Spectrum Alliance Limited. Company no. 8736143 (England & Wales)   ●   admin@dynamicspectrumalliance.org  
services more quickly, or to make greater efforts to partition or lease, since opportunistic use of 
the band will demonstrate that smaller ISPs and other users are finding value in the unused 
portions of their  license area.  This will discourage spectrum warehousing and increase access 
for operators that are ready to deploy, but who lack needed spectrum access in that local area.  
Second, opportunistic access further encourages secondary market transactions by 
facilitating price discovery on both the supply and demand side. For licensees, it will both 
identify users interested in a potential lease or partition and provide information on the potential 
value (i.e., how much is my spectrum worth?). For users, opport unistic use is an opportunity to 
test the local market and to determine the value of a more secure, longer -term lease or partition 
agreement (i.e., how much am I willing to pay for spectrum?).  
Third, opportunistic access will lower barriers to entry for in novative new use cases by 
parties that at least initially either cannot afford or do not believe they need to pay for exclusive 
use and interference protection. The option to deploy, at least initially, without committing to the 
cost of a long -term lease o r license could be particularly useful for small rural ISPs, such as 
WISPs that currently rely on unlicensed spectrum. Although the duration of opportunistic access 
is uncertain, they can at a minimum use it to increase capacity.  
Opportunistic access coul d also enable individual enterprises to incorporate the unused 
and available spectrum to enhance a wide variety of networks and deployments – on campuses, 
inside venues, factories, school buildings and other facilities. The Commission recognized this 
oppor tunity in its 2018 CBRS Order, stating that : “Targeted use cases are already encouraged by",9,DSA Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing of Spectrum - NPRM Comments (signed).pdf,DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

Dynamic Spectrum Alliance Limited. Company no. 8736143 (England & Wales)   ●   admin@dynamicspectrumalliance.org  
the “use -or-share” nature of the band and the GAA tier.”15 Just as unused PAL spectrum will 
enhance the utility of deployments that rely primarily on GAA spectrum, o pportunistic access to 
licensed spectrum in other bands could enhance the capacity and utility of a variety of new and 
innovative use cases in addition to small and rural ISPs.  
Finally, as described more fully in the next section, an automated database can  greatly 
reduce the costs of secondary market transactions. Among other value -added services, a database 
operator could incorporate blockchain technology “to verify and execute spectrum sharing 
agreements between primary and secondary users in licensed spe ctrum.  An anticipated 
advantage of a spectrum blockchain is that secondary market transactions can be automated, 
subject to predetermined conditions, and transparent to permitted users as well as to the 
regulator.”16 
IV. Dynamic Databases Can Help Reduce Trans action Costs.  
The Commission should adopt automated database technology to reduce transaction costs 
and create conditions for robust secondary markets. Dynamic database management is a reality 
today and should not be viewed by the Commission as speculativ e or theoretical.17 In the CBRS 
band, for example, the SAS coordinates CBRS frequency use and relative rights between the 
GAA and PAL tier, manages coexistence, registers and authorizes CBRS radio devices,

maintains network data and configurations, and prov ides SAS users with information on the 
spectrum environment.18 Leveraging these capabilities for secondary markets would allow 
potential buyers to determine actual spectrum usage and find deployment opportunities, 
coordinate rights between licensees and les sees, and ensure coexistence and compliance with 
protection criteria. Taken one step further, databases could administer secondary transaction 
themselves -- for instance, by creating a spectrum exchange employing blockchain technology --
by registering, autho rizing, and enforcing standard, non -complex secondary market transactions. 
For example, an opportunistic lessee could be authorized by a database to deploy a network 
within a certain geographical area at a given frequency and power level, provided that the  lessee 
agreed to pay offered price and deployment didn’t create interference (at which point the 
database could shut down the usage). 
Dynamic databases can also be employed to monitor and enforce build out requirements 
in real t ime. Today the SAS maintai ns comprehensive real -time information about network 
deployment in CBRS. This capability could be leveraged by the Commission to shorten build out 
deadlines (e.g., from ten to five years), expand buildout requirements to cover rural or 
underserved areas, a nd reduce or eliminate the ability of licensees to engage in limited or 
temporary deployments to meet the letter of the requirement, thereby undermining the 
policy aims of build out rules.

CONCLUSION  
The Commission has an opportunity to create efficient secondary markets and DSA 
presented two long -standing and related solutions that can help achieve the goals of this 
proceeding: the “use -it-or-share -it” regulatory framework and the dynamic sharing management 
through databases. These appro aches provide feasible and effective conditions to provide 
connectivity to underserved communities and to encourage innovation by lowering barriers to 
spectrum entry through leasing, partition or disaggregation.

COMMENTS OF CALIFORNIA INTERNET, L.P. DBA GEOLINKS  
 
California Internet, L.P. DBA GeoLinks (“GeoLinks” or the “Company”) submits these 
Comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ NPRM ”) issued March 15 , 2019 
in the aforementioned proceeding .1 
 
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  
GeoLinks is one of the fastest growing Internet and phone providers in America and the 
fastest growing telecom in California.  As such, and in order to be truly competitive within its 
service territory, the Company has a vested interest in promoting policies that allow fixed 
wireless broadband service providers to access spectrum resources suitable to providing high -
speed broadband service.  GeoLinks has advocated in several proceedings before the Commission that additional spectrum resources are necessary in order for fixed wireless 
providers to compete in the broadband marketplace.   
Traditionally, fixed wireless ISPs have operated in the unlicensed bands (i.e. 2.4 and 5 
GHz).  While several fixed wireless providers, including GeoLinks, have been successful in 
utilizing the unlicensed bands, their application is limited.  GeoLinks commends the work that 
the Commission is doing to explor e making additional bands available for wireless broadband 
uses.  However, the immediate proceeding presents an opportunity  to 1) ensure that spectrum 
resources that have already been allocated for broadband use are fully utilized and 2) allow

II. DISCUSSION  
A. The Commission Should Not Reduce Performance Requirements but Should 
Instead Strictly Enforce the Requirements Currently in Place  
Spectrum is, first and foremost, a public resource  that should be allocated and assigned in 
ways that ensure robust use.  However, all too often, large companies purchase spectrum  licenses 
as an asset or for use only in desired communities or locations within a license  area (leaving the 
rest of the area u nserved).   This results in spectrum resources that could be benefitting 
consumers now (especially in rural areas) being left unused.  Without proper policies in place that incentivize license holders  to either use the spectrum they have or let someone els e use it, 
this cycle will continue.  As the Commission determines what rules it wishes to implement with respect to partitioning and disaggregation of spectrum licenses, GeoLinks asks that it ensure its 
rules will prevent spectrum warehousing.    
As one me ans to avoid warehousing, GeoLinks has previously advocated for higher  
buildout and performance requirements for new spectrum licenses .  Regardless of the band or 
license size, it is GeoLinks’ belief that a license holder should be held to a high standard for spectrum utilization.  And, if the license holder is unable or unwilling to meet these 
requirements, it should have the obligation to find someone who will  or relinquish that license to 
the Commission .  In the NPRM, the Commission asks,  “whether reduced performance 
requirements for partitioned or disaggregated licenses would facilitate the deployment of 
advanced telecommunications se rvices in rural areas.”
2  GeoLinks’ response to this question is a 
resounding no.  The Company believes that performance requirements need to be stronger in 
order to  adequately incentivize license holders to either build out across their entire license area 
or lease the remaining spectrum to another entity.  While GeoLinks  would like stricter 
requirements for all spectrum licenses , it understands that current rules pertaining to existing 
                                                           
2 NPRM at para. 15.",1,Comments of GeoLinks Partitioning and Disaggregation 6.3.19.pdf,Geolinks,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"licenses are already in place.  At a minimum, GeoLinks urges the Commi ssion to enforce its 
existing rules to the fullest extent possible.   
If the original licensee is held to a strict performance standard (subject to potential 
enforcement actions) and is unable or unwilling to meet those standards, then it will be  more 
likely to be proactive about either selling or leasing the spectrum it is not using within its license 
area.  This is especially true if the receiving party  is also held to the same buildout  standards and 
the completion of those standards is applicable to both the receiving party  and the original 
license holder.   Decreased performance requirements would simply lead to more of the same.  As 
the NPRM notes “while reduced buildout requirements m ay increase the number of licensees 
willing to lease spectrum, it may also decrease deployment of advanced wireless services in 
those license areas as a result of the reduced performance requirements.”3  This is because new 
licensees c ould still pick and c hoos e within a license area.  While more area overall may  be 
served, the most far reaching and low -density areas (i.e. those in desperate need of  access to 
advanced broadband services) would likely still be left out.  For these reasons, GeoLinks urges the Commission to take steps to strongly enforce its existing requirements and to refrain from 
reducing these requirements any further.   
B. Other Incentives May Encourage Licensees to Lease or Sell Spectrum  
In addition to retaining existing performance requirements and strict enforcement, in 
order to incentivize license holders to sell/ lease unused spectrum, GeoLinks also suggests that 
the Commission consider using the percentage of un or underutilized spect rum across a license 
holder’s license areas  during future spectrum allocation processes, including auctions.  Much like 
higher latency was weighted against bidders in the recent Connection America Fund Phase II 
Auction,
4 so too should high percentages of un and underutilized spectrum resources be for those 
bidding on additional spectrum.  If a company has spectrum it’s simply not using, it should not 
be able to obtain more, especially within the SAME license area (i.e. the same PEA/ county/ 
etc.).  The poss ibility of not being able to obtain more spectrum in the most desirable area s, 
combined with strictly enforced performance requirements, should incentivize license holders to

"lease/ sell their excess spectrum.  This will, in turn, open up more resources for smaller wireless 
service providers  that may not be able to successfully outbid larger companies at auction.   
C. The Commission Should Not Allow Reaggregation  
In the NPRM, the Commission asks whether allowing spectrum reaggregation would help 
incentivize mo re parties to lease or sell spectrum.5  As an initial matter, the purpose of the 
NPRM is to further the Commission’s efforts to “increase spectrum access by small and rural 
carriers.”6  Allowing large carriers to lease off undesired spectrum within their license area and 
then reaggregat e pieces later when they become desirable does little to promote this goal.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth herein, GeoLinks urges the Commission to create r ules for 
spectrum partitioning and disaggregation that 1) ensure that spectrum resources that have already 
been allocated for broadband use are fully utilized and 2) allow smaller and rural -focused 
companies to obtain dedicated spectrum resources.  Specifi cally, GeoLinks suggests that the 
Commission retain existing performance requirements (with enforcement), consider the 
percentage of unused spectrum a carrier has in spectrum auction proceedings, and refrain from 
allowing reaggregation of license areas.

 Dear Ms. Dortch:    On March 7, 2019, Claude Aiken, President and CEO of the Wireless Internet Service 
Providers Association (“WISPA”), and the undersi gned met with Rachael Bender, Legal Advisor 
to Chairman Ajit Pai, to discuss matters related to the above-referenced proceedings. 
 WT Docket No. 19-38   The WISPA representatives asked that th e Commission seek comment in the upcoming 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on whether the be nefits intended by the proposed rules should 
be extended to rural broadband providers that ar e not “carriers” as defi ned in Section 616 of 
MOBILE NOW Act.

 “carriers” would exclude broadband providers that  are not “common carriers” and provide fewer 
options for larger carriers wishing to disaggregate, partition, or leas e spectrum to rural providers.  
 ET Docket No. 13-49   The WISPA representatives reiterated support for the Commission’s adoption of a 
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with re spect to the 5850-5925 MHz band (the “5.9 GHz 
band”).
2  We emphasized that the Commission should understand that the 5.9 GHz band is useful 
not just for Wi-Fi but for rural broadband under rules that are similar to those used in the 
adjacent 5 GHz U-NII band.     WT Docket No. 18-120    The WISPA representatives highlighted memb ers’ strong interest in obtaining access to 
2.5 GHz spectrum and support for rules that eliminat e inefficient spectrum allocation processes.  
With respect to existing license d spectrum, we explained that a voluntary incentive auction could 
be difficult given that most ex isting licenses are encumbered by spectrum leases that create 
contractual rights.  With respect to unassi gned EBS spectrum, the WISPA representatives 
reiterated WISPA’s preference for an auction wi th appropriate safeguards to ensure that one 
entity could not acquire all availa ble spectrum in a geographic market.
3  We indicated that 
WISPA does not object to ensuri ng that auction proceeds are deposited in a “homework gap” 
fund should the Commission have or obtain such authority.  
 
Pursuant to Section 1.1206 of the Commission’s Rules, this letter is being filed in ECFS 
in each of the above-referenced dockets.  Please do not hesitate to cont act the undersigned with 
any questions.

Dear Ms. Dortch,  
 
ACT | The App Association ( the App Association) represents more than 5,000 app makers and 
connected device companies located across the United States and the globe that power the 
global digital economy. Our members  leverage the connectivity of smart devices to create 
innovative solutions that make our lives better.  Our members provide the touchpoint to the 
mobile revolution, which continues to create new efficiencies across consumer and enterpris e 
sectors, from finance to healthcare to manufacturing  to entertainment . As detailed in our 
annual State of the App Economy report, the $1.7 trillion app ecosystem is led by U.S. 
companies that employ more than 5.9 million Americans.  More than 80 percent o f the top U.S. 
app companies are located outside of Silicon Valley, and many are headquartered in rural 
areas, but all depend on strong broadband to grow and create new jobs.  
 
On March 3, 2020, the App Association released a new economic analysis showing t hat 
deployment of the 5G wireless network will create 8.5 million jobs in the United States over the",0,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

next five years.  The report , “An Economic Analysis of 5G Wireless Deployment: Impact on 
U.S. and Local Economies ,” examines the potential of 5G technology to unleash improvements 
in economic productivity, employment, and consumer value. We are pleased to pr esent  this 
report , appended to this ex parte , to the Commission.  
 
5G will be an important  driver of economic growth in the nation  by offering higher transmission 
rates, more reliable  connectivity, and lower  latency, allowing businesses and consumers to 
perform existing and entirely new tasks better and  cheaper.  The App Association’s report 
examines the potential of 5G as a general -purpose technology to unleash  improvements in 
economic  productivity, employment, and consumer value. Investment s in creat ing 5G networks 
contribute  directly to  U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ), and $225 billion in capital 
expenditure will be needed over the next seven years or so to fully  deploy 5G.  However, this 
direct effect on GDP is only a small part of the total economic effects of  broadband in general , 
and 5G in particular.  
 
5G will affect the labor market through direct and indirect means.  While t he additional  labor 
required to build out the ne twork to deploy 5G will certainly create the most immediate demand 
for new jobs , the broadest impact on the labor  market comes from new employment 
opportunities through the way 5G will enable new  applications, services, ways of doing 
business, and general growth of businesses.  These workers will  earn more than $560 billion 
during that time, create $1.7 trillion in additional output, and add over  $900 billion to U.S.  GDP.  
 
Businesses and consumers will also benefit from 5G networks.  The internet of things (I oT) and 
5G will be a major source of productivity improvements and competitive advantage for 
businesses.  The 5G ecosystem will also create much value for consumers, who can look 
forward to peak  mobile broadband transmission speeds of about 10 to 20 times f aster than 4G 
LTE.  The true  promise of 5G and IoT for consumers lies in doing completely new things using 
mobile and fixed  wireless and IoT technology devices, such as healthcare devices, 
autonomous vehicles and traffic  management systems, the smart grid f or revolutionizing 
energy management, smart home  technology, and wearable devices.  
 
The App Association’s report also explores how n ext-generation wireless networks hold 
special promise for economic development in rural and  economically lagging areas by 
expanding labor and output markets beyond isolated geographical  areas, filling gaps in 
existing wired and wireless broadband coverage, and granting access to  healthcare, 
educational, and other expertise in urban or more advantaged areas.  Case studies on  four 
cities (Los Angeles , California;  New York, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Roanoke , 
Virginia ) show that even the direct economic  impacts from deploying the 5G network are large.  
Employment created by network construction,  complementary capital e xpenditures  in private 
industry, and consumer spending on 5G -enabled devices and  5G service are expected to 
create 250,000 jobs in Los Angeles, up to 120,000 jobs in  New York City, 22,000 jobs in 
Pittsburgh, and 2,700 jobs in Roanoke.  These  estimates, alon g with the forecasted national 
economic impacts, are supported with careful  economic modeling based on established 
methods for regional economic analysis.",1,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

II. Introduction In an increasingly mobile and wireless world, 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology. The key advantages of 5G are higher transmission rates, more reliable connectivity, and lower latency (the time it takes for a source to send a packet of data to a receiver). These capabilities allow businesses and consumers to perform existing tasks better and cheaper, but—more importantly—allow entirely new types of productive activity to take place. This report examines the potential of 5G to unleash improvements in economic productivity, employment, and consumer value. Much of the great promise of 5G for economic growth stems from its role as a general-purpose technology (GPT). A GPT is pervasive, has high potential for technical improvements, is greatly useful to businesses, and can be employed to increase the productivity of R&D in downstream",6,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"sectors (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). Thus, GPT reshapes systems of production and distribution, with wide-ranging effects throughout the economy. Mobile broadband internet access is a GPT (Prieger, 2013), is an increasingly essential part of the information economy, and is a necessary foundation for the “next production revolution” coming with the diffusion of the Internet of Things, robotics, and mobile artificial intelligence (Atkinson, 2018). 5G is thus important to the economic health of a region and the national economy. 5G refers the collection of standards and technologies in the fifth generation of cellular communications technology. In addition to operating frequencies currently used for cellular communications, 5G wireless networks also will use new radio frequencies, such as those above 6 GHz, to maximize improvements in transmission speed, latency, and reliability over previous generations of mobile networks. Such high frequencies do not propagate as far as lower frequencies for a given amount of power to the antenna, and so key to the 5G network architecture in most locations is the “small cell.”2 Small cells are smaller, lower-power base stations used to send and receive wireless traffic. Since each has a smaller effective area of coverage than the macrocells used in previous generations, small cell sites will be deployed 10 to 100 times more densely (Al Amine et al., 2017). The low power requirements of small cell technology means that the radio equipment can be no larger than a mini fridge, and thus can be deployed easily on buildings, poles, and other existing private and municipal infrastructure. Some of the most immediate impacts on the economy will come from the expenditure on construction of the small cell sites necessary to roll out the 5G network. Much of the excitement about 5G is related to the Internet of Things (IoT). Key to IoT is connectivity. IoT is the system composed of interrelated computing devices, sensors, machines, data centers, objects, people, and even animals with the ability to transfer data among them without requiring direct human intervention. While 5G and IoT are separate concepts, 5G wireless mobile internet is vitally connected to the future of IoT. IoT is growing at a high rate as more devices become connected and additional applications are developed. In 2019, there were 2.7 billion IoT connections in North America alone, and that figure is projected to increase to 5.9 billion by 2025.3 The increased capacity of the 5G network can accommodate more connected devices, moving more data through the network with lower latency (which degrades local network performance as more devices are added), thus enabling the continued growth of IoT (Lanner, 2017). While 5G and IoT are separate concepts, 5G wireless mobile internet is vitally connected to the future of IoT. In the rest of this report, the expected economic impacts of 5G are discussed. The expected importance of 5G for economic development in general, based on the experience with previous generation networks, is covered in the next section. The extent to which 5G can improve the productivity of businesses and the economy, create jobs and raise wages, and create new value for consumers are discussed in turn. The special benefits that 5G can create for rural and",7,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"economically disadvantaged areas are also presented. In section IV, the specific estimates of the job creation and other economic impacts of 5G for the nation and selected cities are presented. III. The importance of 5G for economic development 5G, as with other forms of broadband, will be an important driver of continued economic growth in the U.S. This is seen most obviously with the direct contribution to GDP of the investment that will be necessary to deploy next-generation wireless infrastructure. Private investment in broadband appears directly in GDP.4 Given the huge amount that broadband providers have invested in the United States, the direct contribution of infrastructure investment is sizeable. Since 1996, broadband providers in the U.S. have invested over 1.6 trillion dollars in private capital expenditure on fixed and mobile broadband, and over $720 billion in the last ten years alone.5 In 2018, American broadband providers invested roughly around $80 billion in total infrastructure.6 The top providers in the U.S. invested an estimated $30 billion on wireless broadband capex in 2018, with another $33 billion slated for 2019.7 These investments have been required to expand steadily the availability and speed of fixed and mobile broadband service offered to consumers. Broadband internet access also appears in GDP as personal consumption item. In 2017, Americans spent $76.1 billion on internet access services, increasing GDP by that amount.8 However, these direct entries in the national income accounts are only the tip of the iceberg. As a general-purpose technology, 5G will increase the productivity of businesses, create jobs and increase wages in the labor market, and create value for consumers far beyond what they pay for it. This section discusses those advantages of 5G and IoT, and concludes with a special look at the promise of next generation networks for rural and economically disadvantaged areas. A. Impacts on labor markets and job creation As with other areas of economic impact, 5G will affect the labor market through direct and indirect means. The broadest impact on the labor market comes from new employment opportunities through the way 5G will enable new applications, services, ways of doing business, and general growth of businesses. And when the productivity of labor rises, wages increase. Economists refer to such network externalities of 5G as positive spillovers. While these broad impacts on employment may take time to develop, as new business plans that rely on 5G are created throughout the economy, other more direct impacts will be felt immediately. The additional labor required to build out the network to deploy 5G will create the most immediate demand for new jobs. In this section, the positive labor market externalities are considered first, then the direct impacts of 5G deployment. The broadest impact on the labor market comes from new employment opportunities through the way 5G will enable new applications, services, ways of doing business, and general growth of businesses.",8,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"1. Positive externalities on employment As 5G diffuses through the economy, it will create network externalities far beyond the communications sector. Businesses that use technologies like 5G and IoT to become more productive and efficient will grow, and growing businesses (and the businesses that provide inputs to them) require more workers. Experience from previous generations and other forms of broadband is again instructive. The most relevant broadband externalities for job creation are the new applications and services it enables, the new revenue its adoption produces for businesses, and the growth in certain industries that become heavy users of the new technology. For example, IoT will involve massive amounts of data to be collected, aggregated, and analyzed. While much of the first two steps will be automated, data analysis will often involve skilled workers, and even the necessary support for data collection and aggregation will depend on workers in the field of information and communications technology (ICT). As another example, 5G will allow telemedicine, based in part on remote wearable or home-based health sensors, to expand in rural areas, creating opportunities for local and remote healthcare workers and technicians to assist patients. 5G can also increase employment by drawing new workers into the labor force. The preference for a work environment that allows its employees to dictate when and where they work is growing in popularity, particularly among younger workers, and 5G mobile broadband access will enable ever more creative forms of flexible working arrangements (Hanson, 2019). This greatly expands both the pool of potential hires for any given firm, who can hire the best-fitting workers regardless of where they live, and the potential labor force, as more flexible labor arrangements draw more people into employment. Indeed, empirical studies have found that increases in local employment associated with broadband deployment arise mostly from new workers entering the labor force, not just from the unemployed finding new jobs (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband in general and 5G in particular can also affect employment in less direct—but no less important—ways. Some rural and minority populations face challenges to employment from poor health and healthcare, educational deficiencies, and lack of access to transportation and government services. IoT has great promise to lower the cost of delivering many of these services, which can potentially solve, or at least lessen, some of these challenges facing isolated communities (Turner Lee, 2019). Since the externalities from 5G affect most of the economy, the estimates of job creation from this aspect of 5G are large. To support the new revenue streams in the IoT value chain alone, a white paper from the World Economic Forum estimates that more than 400,000 new jobs in the U.S. will be required (WEF, 2017).9 Including all indirect impacts, Al Amine et al. (2017) estimate that the adoption of 5G technology into the broader economy will create an additional 2.2 million jobs.10 These estimates depend on the amount of investment and R&D assumed to be required for 5G deployment; when those are assumed to be higher than the job creation figures rise accordingly. For example, IHS Markit (2017) estimates that investment of $1.2 trillion of R&D and $1.1 trillion of capital expenditure will be needed over 16 years to fully deploy 5G worldwide, which by the year 2035 will support 22 million jobs worldwide in the 5G value chain, with 3.4 million of those jobs being in the U.S.11",9,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Complementing the estimates above, which are based on value-chain analyses built from input-output analysis, econometric studies have also attempted to measure directly the impact of broadband on employment. For the early years of wired broadband, for example, econometric studies found that each one percent of penetration resulted in 0.2 to 5.3 percent employment growth.12 The results vary due to the different data, methods, and years studied, but the positive link to job creation is found in many studies. Later studies also found positive links between broadband availability and increased employment, particularly during the recession years around 2008 when there was significant slack in the economy (Katz and Suter, 2009; Holt and Jamison, 2009).13  The employment impacts of broadband are not limited to the early generations of wired and wireless technology. 5G will be fast – fast enough to challenge and replace wired broadband in some areas. Econometric studies that specifically examine very high-speed broadband (often defined in the literature as a download transmission rate of at least 1 Gbps) find that its availability is positively related to county-level employment in the U.S. (Bai, 2017; Lobo et al., 2019) and negatively related to the unemployment rate in France (Hasbi, 2017). The latter study is particularly notable for the large effect found14 and its numerous techniques used to verify the causality of the association. Scholars have also researched the industry-specific impact of broadband and found that the job creation effect exists mainly in technology-concentrated industries (Kolko, 2012) and high-end service industries such as finance and insurance, education services and health care services (Crandall et al., 2007). These industries, of course, depend on a highly skilled workforce. The important connection between broadband and high-skilled labor is highlighted by the econometric study of Atasoy (2013), who found that broadband availability increases employment and wages more in areas with more skilled workers and in industries and occupations that require highly skilled and educated workers. Similar results along these lines in a study of firm-level data from Norway showed that broadband availability and adoption complements the abilities of high-skill workers, increasing their productivity, wages, and employment (Akerman et al., 2015).  Thus it is important that IoT can improve the learning process in education, for example by facilitating interaction between physical and virtual objects and students in the learning environment in the context of virtual academic communities (Marquez et al., 2016). Such communities will broaden educational opportunities, particularly in rural and otherwise isolated areas, as will the greater accessibility of education and effectiveness of distance learning enabled by 5G. Eventually, future IoT learning models will be virtual interactive environments that are “learner-centric, skill-centric, on-demand and personalized... improving student development in the areas of critical-thinking and collaborative learning” (Mirzamany et al., 2016).15 Thus the possibility of a virtuous cycle, whereby workers gain education and skills facilitated by 5G and IoT, and then have increased employment due to the impact of broadband in the economy. In closely related work to the employment studies, Hasbi (2017), Mack (2014), McCoy et al. (2018) show that broadband spurs local business creation, which almost by definition creates new",10,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"employment (now or in the future). Indeed, Falck (2017) concludes that the “employment effects of broadband introduction likely arise from job creation in newly founded establishments.” Mack and Rey (2014) show that broadband availability is positively linked to the number of knowledge intensive businesses in particular.16  Importantly, their results imply that broadband can increase the numbers of such businesses not only in areas with concentrations of knowledge intensive firms, but also areas without, making broadband infrastructure particularly important for development.  The positive effects of broadband on the labor market are not limited to reducing unemployment. Economists have drawn attention to the large number of Americans who dropped out of the labor force after the last recession; such former workers do not appear in official unemployment statistics.17 Broadband at home can draw people into the labor force through telework and saving time in home production. For example, Dettling (2017) found that high-speed internet use in the home leads to a 4.1 percentage point increase in labor force participation for married women. As discussed above, 5G and IoT will greatly enhance the prospects for remote employment and virtual workplaces. What about the fear that as businesses use ever more ICT such as 5G, jobs are put at risk as “machines replace people”? Changes in the structure of the economy due to technological progress are at least as old as the Industrial Revolution and require careful attention to the education, flexibility, and continued reskilling of the workforce. However, the evidence above shows that in the case of broadband ICT the labor market impacts appear to be positive on net. Furthermore, the available research specific to wireless broadband internet access does not support that worry. In a cross-country econometric study of how short-run labor demand is affected by various forms of ICT used by businesses, Biagi and Falk (2017) found no evidence that mobile broadband usage by employees destroys jobs.  2. Impact of network construction on employment Deploying the infrastructure necessary for the 5G network will require much labor. CTIA (2018), the trade association for America’s wireless industry, estimates that in 2018 the U.S. had only 86,000 small cell sites, out of the estimated 800,000 expected to be built by 2026 if regulatory hurdles do not disrupt the necessary investment. Of that total, about 300,000 will need to be built by 2022 (Safer et al., 2018a). Building that many new network sites and the infrastructure needed to serve them will create many jobs. Some studies use methodology akin to the present analysis to estimate the jobs impact of 5G infrastructure deployment. The report by Accenture (Al Amine et al., 2017) estimates that building the 5G network will create 50,000 new construction jobs in the U.S. each year to install new wireless infrastructure over a seven-year period. Including the industries supporting and supplying the construction effort, total direct employment creation rises to 120,000 jobs per year. Including all areas of wireless investment in 5G networks, the report arrives at a total of about 429,000 jobs each year.18 Accenture’s estimate of construction jobs is similar to the estimates computed here and discussed in section IV.B.1 below.19 The estimates presented there,",11,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"however, are larger even than Accenture’s total jobs figure because the present estimates include employment from other parts of the 5G ecosystem. Such estimates are in line with econometric estimates of existing forms of broadband; Hasbi (2017) found that when a very high-speed broadband network has been deployed in a municipality, it created (or attracted) new construction firms, and therefore construction jobs. In particular, fiber networks increase the number of construction companies by 4.7% due to the deployment, installation, and maintenance needs of the networks. B. Improved productivity and competitive advantages for businesses IoT and 5G will be a major source of productivity improvements and competitive advantage for businesses, first through creating operational efficiencies and next through new business models and other forms of innovation in processes and products (K@W, 2016). Productivity is enhanced by lowering the transaction costs involved in monitoring, measuring, and managing business activities. IoT sensors with remote monitoring capabilities lower such costs of controlling inputs and outputs.20  Of course, IoT and 5G are not just about devices; connected devices and the enhanced communications experience offered by 5G will make possible increased engagement of employees. The superior indoor and outdoor mobile broadband experience will make many workers more productive. 5G will further the move toward virtual and remote teamwork with enterprises by enabling streaming of ultra-high definition video and telepresence, augmented and virtual reality (smart glasses), and tactile internet (IHS, 2017).21 Smart glasses can improve productivity, for example, by providing remote support from centralized specialists to workers in the field. IoT-based improvement in the management of mobile devices, inventory and assets, safety and security, and workers and their time can boost productivity as well (NET, 2017). Past experience with previous broadband, communications, and mobile technologies shows that we can expect 5G to usher new improvements in the productivity of labor. Some studies have considered the labor productivity impacts of broadband in general, including wired and wireless, fixed and mobile. Some studies use data from individual firms. For example, Akerman et al. (2015) show that broadband availability and adoption at the firm level increases the productivity of highly skilled labor. Their econometric estimations indicate that increasing broadband availability by 10 percent raises a firm’s output by 0.4 percent on average (holding other productive inputs constant). The average effects can mask a large amount of heterogeneity across industries and countries, of course. However, a study of 400,000 observations on firms in European countries showed that in a majority of those nations there is a significant positive relationship between employees’ access to broadband and the firms’ labor productivity in both manufacturing and service industries (Hagsten, 2016).22 Other studies on labor productivity look specifically at mobile broadband. In a cross-country econometric study, Gruber and Koutroumpis (2011) find that mobile telephony and broadband usage increases output per worker-hour, contributing 0.19 percentage points to annual productivity growth in the United States.23 Bertschek and Niebel (2016) examine how 3G and 4G",12,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"mobile internet access affected the labor productivity of workers in Germany. Their results suggest that the former is causally and positively linked to the latter. A ten point increase in the percentage of employees using the mobile internet is associated with increased labor productivity (sales per employee) in the range of 1.7% to 9.3%, depending on the regression method and control variables employed. Improved labor productivity also results in increased economic productivity overall and faster GDP growth, as will be discussed in section IV below. C. Creating new value for consumers Economists typically measure net benefits to consumers with consumer surplus, a quantity reflecting that most people would be willing to pay more for a good or service than the price actually paid in the market. As early as 2005, the annual consumer surplus created by the internet was estimated to be about $3,000 per person (Goolsbee and Klenow, 2006). Greenstein and McDevitt (2011) measure total consumer surplus associated with diffusion of broadband service to be between $4.8 and $6.7 billion in the U.S. between 1999 and 2006. Specific uses of internet access also can create large amounts of value. Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012) estimate the consumer surplus from free online services such as Facebook, Google, Wikipedia and YouTube to be almost $100 billion for users in the U.S. Cohen et al. (2016) estimate $6.8 billion in consumer surplus from the UberX car service in the U.S. in 2015 alone. It is important to note that these welfare gains are completely overlooked by statistics on GDP or anything else in the official national economic accounts, including the economic impacts calculated in the present report. Much of the value of 5G and IoT will be largely hidden from consumers, as Smart Grids, machine-to-machine wireless communication, and Smart Supply Chains work out of view. Nevertheless, the 5G ecosystem will also create much value for consumers. Many consumers look forward to 5G mobile broadband to get and do more of what they are used to on their devices, but faster. Video will take less time to load, and higher quality video becomes feasible to consume on mobile devices. With peak transmission speeds of about 10 to 20 times faster than 4G LTE, 5G will be fast enough to replace wired broadband networks to access the internet in many homes. In some areas of the country, 5G wireless will extend high-speed internet to place where the wired broadband network is lacking, as previous generations of mobile broadband have done.24 But in addition to doing the same things faster, the true promise of 5G and IoT for consumers lies in doing completely new things. Healthcare Wearable and home medical monitoring devices connected to IoT can link patients directly to healthcare providers. Examples of such devices include heart rate monitors, fall detection equipment for the elderly, microphones to measure air flow in the breathing of patients with lung disease, and ingestible sensors to detect internal bleeding or monitor adherence to medication plans (Pradhan, 2019; Turner Lee, 2019). If 5G is deployed in a timely fashion, the healthcare segment of IoT is forecast to grow to be a $180 billion market in 2022.25",13,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Transportation Autonomous vehicles of the future – 21 million of them in the U.S. by 203026 – will rely on 5G networks to make driving smarter and safer. The data generated from the dozens or hundreds of sensors in each vehicle must be transmitted and analyzed nearly instantaneously to allow the vehicle to make complex driving decisions in real time. Such volumes of vehicular data – forecasted to be up to 2 petabits a week per car in the future – require 5G’s large bandwidth to turn autonomous vehicles into mobile data centers (Llanasas, 2019). 5G will thus be a key enabler in the creation of a market for self-driving vehicles forecasted to be worth $2.8 trillion by 2030.27 Autonomous vehicles can also be convoyed into groups by traffic management systems, whether such platooning is centralized (i.e., coordinated by an authority) or decentralized (coordinated spontaneously by independent vehicle-agents) (Halle et al., 2004). Platooning reduces traffic congestion, thus saving time and money for commuters. Closely spaced vehicles in platoons also save fuel and energy, much like race car drivers or peloton cyclists do when drafting on leaders. All told, autonomous vehicles are estimated to provide benefits to consumers and society of $2,000 to $4,000 per vehicle, with the higher figure applying after accounting for the comprehensive benefits of crashes avoided (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2015). But the benefits are not limited to those owning self-driving cars. Even for those people without autonomous vehicles, platooning of the trucking industry will lower transportation costs, and this reduces prices of delivered intermediate and final goods (Adler, et al., 2016). Also for people without vehicles, 5G will increase the quality of public transportation and potentially lower its cost. With increased wireless information about where riders are waiting or currently using the system, 5G enables Smart Transportation such as dynamic routing of buses and light rail (Al Amine et al., 2017). Energy The addition of currently unconnected, energy-hungry appliances and devices to IoT will allow better management of the electricity energy network. The resulting Smart Grid enabled by 5G connections will better manage electricity demand and balance loads away from peak periods, thereby reducing electricity costs and ultimately prices (Al Amine et al., 2017). 5G can reduce municipal energy costs through smart public lighting, as already deployed in cities such as Sacramento. The millions of dollars saved in municipal electricity costs can result in lower taxes (or at least lower growth in taxes), leading to more disposable income for residents. Annual investment on smart grids in the U.S. is projected to be $13.7 billion 2024,28 but only if 5G infrastructure has been adequately deployed in a timely fashion. Other aspects of IoT for consumers Other aspects of IoT for consumers include the following: • Smart Homes. From home security to energy usage to control of rooms and entertainment systems, Smart Home applications can make households safer, more comfortable, more enjoyable, and cheaper to maintain. At the same time, energy bills and the carbon footprint of the household can be reduced through increased efficiency in energy usage. The Smart Home sector is forecast to be a $43.7 billion market by 2023.29",14,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"• Personal asset tracking. From smart phones to pets to any asset fitted with a tracker tag, 5G IoT networks enable tracking of valuable assets.   • Wearable personal technology. From fitness devices to smart glasses, consumer wearables will change how we live and interact with other people, the internet, and our smart homes. Fitness wearables alone will generate an estimated $14.5 billion in revenue in 2019.30 Measuring the economic benefits to consumers created by the 5G revolution will be possible only after there is widespread experience with the technology and data becomes available on how much people value the activities that 5G enables. However, studies of existing forms of broadband and internet access have already shown the huge value they created for consumers, and 5G will almost certainly do the same. D. Special impacts on rural and economically disadvantaged areas Next-generation wireless networks hold special promise for economic development in rural and economically lagging areas by expanding labor and output markets beyond isolated geographical areas, filling gaps in existing wired and wireless broadband coverage, and granting access to healthcare, educational, and other expertise in urban or more advantaged areas. The IoT-related benefits of 5G are not limited to urban areas. Smart watering systems, light sensors, soil sensors, livestock sensors, self-driving tractors, and other devices – Smart Farming – will enable precision farming to improve agricultural productivity. For animal husbandry, IoT and 5G-enabled livestock monitoring can help ranchers gather information on the health and location of their animals.31 Precision farming for crops increases agricultural yields and sustainability through close monitoring of moisture, nutrients, and weather for optimal planting and harvesting with fewer chemical inputs (Liaghat and Balasundram, 2010). While precision farming methods predate IoT, the evolution to Smart Farming allows farm management tasks to be enhanced by context and situational awareness created by data on real-time events (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Furthermore, cloud-based agriculture for unified data, farm, and decision management requires integrated IoT and fast mobile internet (Xin & Zazueta, 2016). By 2024, the market value of precision farming in the U.S. is forecast to be $2.5 billion.32 Mobile broadband helps to fill gaps in fixed broadband coverage in rural areas and can create economic benefits there (Prieger, 2013, 2017). By providing expanded access to very high-speed broadband, 5G deployment in rural areas can ensure that the many consumer benefits discussed in section B above accrue to rural residents as well. For example, lack of adequate bandwidth is holding back telemedicine and remote healthcare monitoring in rural areas, as came up in a recent Congressional hearing (Arndt, 2017). Without high-quality access to the internet, rural students can fail to gain technical competencies and social development in the online context, falling behind their urban peers (Freeman et al., 2016). An econometric study by Whitacre et al. (2014a) examined the impacts of broadband on rural areas over the period 2001 to 2010. This study is notable for its credible econometric approach to identify the causal effect of broadband on employment.33 They find that non-metropolitan counties with high levels of broadband adoption had significantly greater reductions in the unemployment",15,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"rate than otherwise similar counties with lower adoption rates. This finding is in accord with other research concluding that broadband’s positive impact on the labor market is higher in rural areas (Atasoy, 2013). Whitacre et al. (2014a) also find that broadband adoption in rural areas leads to greater increases in household income and greater growth in the number of businesses. Furthermore, the availability of higher broadband speeds in non-metropolitan counties is associated with reductions in the poverty level, “suggesting that broadband speed can potentially contribute to general community well-being” (p.1020). In another study, the same authors also found that broadband adoption contributed to household income in rural areas (Whitacre et al., 2014b). Studies from elsewhere in the developed world confirm that broadband can play an important role in the development of rural economies. In research on broadband expansion in Germany between 2005 and 2009, Fabritz (2013) found that the positive effects on employment seem to be larger in rural municipalities, perhaps because the internet enlarges the market for service firms in rural areas by granting access to customers elsewhere. Ivus and Boland (2015) find that the deployment of broadband in 1997–2011 promoted aggregate employment and average wages in service industries in rural regions of Canada, with overall employment effects 1.2 percentage points per year of employment growth in service industries in rural regions. Next-generation wireless networks can also play an important role for residents in disadvantaged urban areas. Some research suggests that minority users in general and African-Americans in particular rely more heavily than others do on mobile devices for their broadband internet access.34 Mobile phone ownership is much more common among minorities than computer ownership, which helps overcome the hardware barrier to broadband usage. Thus improving the quality of mobile access to the internet is particularly important to these communities. Broadband can help minorities to improve their personal lives. For example, many disadvantaged urban communities face issues similar to rural areas lacking access to high-quality healthcare. Thus, whether through enhancing prospects for participation in online health communities or through providing the necessary bandwidth to enable mobile health applications and devices, as well as the more advanced forms of telemedicine allowed by 5G discussed above, mobile broadband can facilitate access to better health information and care (Prieger, 2015). IV. Quantifying the economic impacts of 5G Putting together all the ways 5G wireless can improve economic performance discussed above, this section discusses evidence on how mobile broadband has affected GDP growth in the past and presents projections of how 5G may be expected to boost the economy going forward.  A. Overall economic impacts of mobile broadband Several econometric studies have investigated how past generations of mobile broadband have increased national economic growth. Such studies can account for the many ways broadband affects the economy without the necessity of assuming exactly which paths lead from investment to ultimate economic outcomes. In one of the first studies looking at the economic impact of",16,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"mobility, Gruber and Koutroumpis (2011) find a sizable positive impact of mobile infrastructure on GDP across many years and countries. The authors calculate that mobile telecommunications contributed 0.4 percentage points to GDP growth in high-income countries like the United States.35 Thompson and Garbacz (2011) also found econometric evidence that mobile broadband has an important effect on GDP, and that it is even more important than the effect from fixed broadband. Their estimates imply that in high income countries like the U.S., an additional mobile broadband line per household increases GDP per household directly by relatively large 4.7%. Furthermore (when indirect impacts are accounted for) mobile broadband decreases the distance between the country’s actual and potential GDP.36 Similarly, Forero (2013) also found that mobile services are significantly and positively associated to decreases in such inefficiency in a country’s production. Other research has examined broadband penetration more broadly to verify that it stimulates economic growth. Czernich, Falck, Kretschmer, and Woessmann (2011) estimate a sophisticated econometric model using data for 25 developed countries during 1996–2007.  The authors find that a 10 percentage point increase in broadband penetration raised annual per capita growth by 0.9–1.5 percentage points. These results are in accord with earlier results from Qiang and Rossotto (2009), who addressed the same question, although the methodology was quite different. Gruber et al. (2014) use data from European Union countries from 2005 to 2011 to evaluate the benefits of broadband deployment and usage. The estimates suggest that broadband adoption rates, as measured by broadband lines (including wireless) had a significant positive effect on GDP in the observed period, with an estimated average annual contribution to GDP of 1.36% for the countries in the sample.  With all such country-level econometric studies associating broadband with increased GDP growth, one must worry about reverse or simultaneous causality. For example, a simple correlation between broadband and GDP growth might reveal only that faster growing economies demand more and better broadband. Nearly all of the studies cited herein address this potential problem with econometric methodology of various types. In a study that specifically address simultaneous causality, Arvin and Pradhan (2014) show that for developed countries such as the U.S., broadband penetration indeed has a causal link to growth in real per capita GDP.37 And in later work for European countries, Pradhan et al. (2019) confirm that causality runs from ICT (including various mobile, internet, and broadband measures) to long-run economic growth.  Research shows that when it comes to the impact on GDP growth from broadband, the faster the better. Kongaut and Bohlin (2014) show that a 10% increase in the average download transmission speed of broadband internet in the country has a statistically significant 0.8% impact on GDP in developed (OECD) countries. It is interesting to consider how much 5G could improve average download speeds. In the U.S., combined fixed and mobile download speed was about 69 Mbps on average in 2018.38 If the proportion of mobile traffic remained the same, then at a conservative estimate of 5G download speed, the overall average broadband download speed would rise to 165 Mbps – a huge increase.39 Since a 140% increase is average speed like this is far outside the range of the data considered in Kongaut and Bohlin’s (2014) study, their results cannot",17,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"be extrapolated to this scenario. Nevertheless, their results and the large speed increases that 5G will make possible suggest that there will be potentially very large improvements in GDP growth. B. New estimates of the economic impacts of 5G network deployment To assess the impact of deploying a national 5G broadband network in the United States, a medium-term analysis covering 2019–2025 was performed.40 The following four economic activities were considered:  1. Capital expenditure in the mobile broadband provision industry to deploy 5G networks. 2. Additional spending in other industries as firms benefit from the 5G broadband deployment and incorporate it into their businesses. 3. Additional spending by mobile broadband subscribers on 5G service, net of what they would have spent on 4G service. This category includes additional spending by enterprises on 5G IoT connectivity. (Enterprise spending on IoT hardware, software, and professional services such as IoT management consulting services and computer systems design services is included in item number 2 above.) 4. Additional spending by consumers on mobile broadband devices – smartphones, computers, and tablets – net of a “4G only” counterfactual. (Enterprise spending on connected devices is included in item number 2 above.) For each category of spending, standard methods of determining national or regional economic impacts based on input-output analysis were followed. The essential idea is that the total economic effects resulting from investment or other spending in the 5G ecosystem are greater than the direct expenditure because any dollar injected into an economy is partially spent again, creating additional economic activity. This additional economic activity is quantified with multipliers showing the relationship between initial spending and final total activity. Impacts are of three types: direct, indirect, and induced. Direct impacts are straightforward: if an extra dollar of output is required from the wireless communications service industry, for example, then a dollar of extra output is created.  The direct impact includes all the inputs purchased by the wireless service industry to deploy 5G: communications equipment, construction, network design services, etc. The indirect effects, on the other hand, reflect that the direct inputs themselves came from supporting upstream industries, and creating the inputs required additional purchases by those industries. Thus the expenditure on capital, connectivity, or services in the ultimate industry results in further rounds of new spending41 as the inputs used by the industries are linked to the outputs of the supplying industries. The final type of economic effect, the induced impact, arises from the additional household spending of workers whose earnings are affected by the investment and who spend that additional income in turn. The modeling software used, IMPLAN, relies mainly on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to calculate economic activity multipliers for regions, industries, and commodities based on regional input-output tables of the flow of goods and services in the economy. The figures presented here are the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects (which are known as impacts based on Type II multipliers).",18,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"The multipliers available to convert expenditure in the 5G ecosystem to total economic outcomes include those for employment, output (sales), value added (GDP), and labor earnings. The total employment change throughout the economy resulting from deployment of wireless broadband is greater than the labor directly employed to design, construct, and operate the network and to create and sell the devices. The employment multiplier estimates how investment spending translates into additional employment.42 In keeping with BEA convention, created jobs are counted as job-years, so that one job for two years or two jobs in the same year are equivalent. The output multiplier is the ratio of the total change in sales to the change in local output purchased by final users. Whereas the output multiplier is for gross sales, the value-added multiplier measures the total change in value added per dollar of investment.43 Hence, the value-added multiplier is comparable to increases in GDP. Since sales inevitably involve double-counting as commodities are passed up and down the supply chain, the GDP multiplier is smaller than the output multiplier. The earnings multiplier measures the increase in labor earnings per dollar of local output purchased through investment.44  Similar analyses using multipliers from input-output analysis to estimate the economic impacts of current and past broadband investment in the United States have been conducted by many researchers.45 Analyses specific to 5G deployment include those of Singer et al. (2017) and Sosa and Rafert (2019). While the methods employed here are standard to input-output analysis, it is important to note potential limitations in the results. The calculations assume there are no changes in commodity or labor prices resulting from the increase in investment. When the economy is at or close to full employment, some of the demand for additional labor may come from reskilling previously employed workers or result in higher wages instead of the full number of jobs predicted here (as businesses seek to attract needed workers). Of course, higher wages benefits workers as well as new job opportunities.  The analysis here also does not include jobs created by the innovation resulting from the investment across private industry as businesses incorporate 5G technology and services into their products, services, and business methods. That is, the economic impacts from spending in categories 1 and 2 are from the capital expenditure, not the innovation following from it. While a few researchers have attempted to estimate such additional economic impacts from broadband technology (e.g., Katz and Suter, 2009), such results are highly speculative. The uncertainty in the estimates results in part because the dynamic links between a new generation of broadband technology and innovation in the wider economy, and between innovation and new jobs, cannot be estimated precisely. Also contributing to the difficulty of such estimation are the potentially competing effects. While innovation that creates new products and sales supports jobs, the relationship between productivity enhancements and employment is unsettled in the literature (Vivarelli, 2014). For the latter, however, note that productivity enhancements raise wages even if the amount of employment is unchanged. Detailed assumptions for the analysis are in the appendix, but the broad outlines of the methodology and assumptions are presented here. For capital expenditure by wireless network service providers, investment is required into communications equipment, network design services,",19,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"and construction. Relying both on extant top-down and bottom-up estimates of the cost of deploying 5G in the U.S., it was estimated that $225B of capital expenditure would be required over the study period (2019–2025). The CAPEX is assumed to be spent on wired and wireless network equipment, fiber optic cable, engineering, programming, and systems design services, and construction. Investment in other industries reflects that 5G is a GPT that creates spillover effects throughout the economy. The importance of broadband and wireless technology for businesses and consumers across the economy has been discussed above. To gain value from 5G and increase productivity, businesses across all private industry will need to invest in 5G-related equipment and services, such as those related to IoT. However, 5G will also create additional investment as firms develop new products, services, and ways of doing business enabled by 5G. For purposes of the calculations, in part due to data limitations, it is assumed that only private industry so benefits from 5G as a GPT.46 The analysis assumes that the past linkages between CAPEX in the broadband industry and CAPEX in other industries, formed in the context of previous generations of broadband services, will continue to hold in the 5G era. A statistical analysis finds that for every 1% additional investment in the Broadcast and Telecommunications industry (the most specific industry group that contains the broadband service provision industry for which investment data are available), the following year there is an additional 0.18% investment in other private industries, followed by a 0.12% reduction the year after that (perhaps due to fixed or constrained CAPEX budgets being shifted earlier in time to take advantage of new opportunities created by new broadband capabilities).47 Thus, over the succeeding two years, a 1% additional investment in telecom leads to a net 0.06% increase in investment in another industry. While this percentage looks small, the rest of the private economy is so large that for every job created directly from investment by the wireless industry about 1.9 jobs are created elsewhere from these spillover effects. This result is in accord with previous studies of broadband and employment.48 To estimate additional expenditure on the provision of 5G mobile wireless service, forecasts of the number of 5G subscribers and the premium paid over 4G were made. While 5G is not expected to result in large price increases, the new service offerings will help preserve the revenue of wireless providers that otherwise is eroding in the late-stage era of 4G LTE. This category of expenditure includes IoT connectivity. However, while growing rapidly during the study period, most IoT expenditure during the limited forecast period analyzed here will be on 3G, 4G, wifi, and other IoT technology apart from 5G. (Analysts expect 5G IoT to take off in a large way during the second half of the next decade.) Thus, the contribution of 5G IoT spending on connectivity to the economic impacts is relatively small through 2025. Any economic impacts due to spending on devices, software, or consulting services for 5G IoT are subsumed into category 2 expenditure. The forecasted additional expenditure on 5G smartphones, computer, and tablets assumes that if 5G were not available, an otherwise equivalent 4G device would have been purchased. Thus only the difference in expenditure between the two types of devices is counted. Economic activity in this area is apportioned to device manufacturers (much of which leaks to foreign makers) as well as to other participants in the supply chain: retailers, wholesalers, and transportation providers.",20,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"In the following sections, the economic impacts of 5G deployment are estimated for the entire nation first and then for selected specific localities.  1. The national economic impact of 5G deployment Deployment of the nationwide 5G network will have large impacts on employment, output, sales, and labor earnings (Table 1). About 8.5 million jobs are created over the study period compared to the 4G-only world, with an average of 1.2 million jobs each year. Workers in those jobs will earn $564 billion total. As shown in the figure, the largest source of jobs is investment throughout the wireless industry (24% of all jobs created) and other private industry (45%). Incremental spending on 5G consumer devices is the next largest category, creating 22% of all jobs. Provision of 5G wireless service (incremental beyond 4G) is the smallest job creator. The 5G-related investment and spending will also create a yearly average of $237 billion in additional sales of output, adding an average of $130 billion each year to GDP in the U.S. economy during 2019–2025. Overall, 5G will add over $900 billion to GDP during the forecast period. This amount is expected to be about 0.6% of total GDP during that time.49 Table 1: Economic Impacts of National 5G Network Deployment   Jobs Labor Earnings Output Value Added (GDP)   000s $B $B $B Total (2019-2025) 8,452.30 563.95 1,660.72 907.29 Average per year 1,207.47 80.56 237.25 129.61",21,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 It is important to note that these estimates are above and beyond a counterfactual scenario in which only current 4G technology continues to exist. As such, these figures are best understood as the gains from 5G deployment and adoption (or, alternatively, an indication of the costs to the U.S. economy if 5G does not fully develop due to regulatory barriers).  However, 5G will help support many more jobs than just these new ones, since wireless broadband affects so much economic activity. For example, the wireless ecosystem (including infrastructure and service providers, device makers, retailers and wholesalers, and content, app, and service creators) directly or indirectly supports between 2.4 to 4.7 million jobs in the U.S., depending on which economic activity is included in the calculations.50 These figures include jobs directly within the wireless industry, as well as indirect jobs in adjacent and supporting industries and induced effects from the household spending based on income received from the jobs. 2. Regional economic analyses For the regional economic analyses, three types of economic impacts from 5G deployment are estimated.51 The first is the economic impact from network construction and deployment in the local area. The direct impact is closest to the analysis conducted for the nation; the chief differences are that spending is smaller at the local level and that the leakages outside the local economy are larger. The fraction of national spending on wireless CAPEX apportioned to the local area was computed using estimates of how 5G deployment cost varies with population density.52 Leakage of economic activity occurs not only because some manufactured goods are imported, but because much of the total economic impact created by local spending accrues to businesses and workers outside the area. For example, spending on fiber optic cable in New York City benefits Wireless Industry CAPEX24%
Other Private Industry CAPEX45%5G Mobile Wireless Service (including IoT)8.5%Consumer Spending on 5G Smartphones, PCs, and Tablets22%",22,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"no local manufacturers, since there are none in the five boroughs.53 This portion of the direct economic impact benefits others in the nation but is an externality from the region’s point of view. The second type of local economic impact is the positive spillover from economic activity elsewhere in the nation as 5G networks are deployed. For example, when a network is deployed outside the local area, local suppliers may make sales or receive contracts for consulting services. These positive externalities generated by outside network deployment are estimated using the local market fractions of the national market for the individual relevant manufactured goods and services. For example, about 2.6% of spending on telephone apparatus (such as network switchgear) in the U.S. benefits manufacturers in the Los Angeles area. Such economic activity flowing into the area from investment outside the area is much smaller than the direct impact. As a third way to estimate the importance of 5G for local areas, employment in the national wireless telecommunications ecosystem can be apportioned to the regions. Beginning with the estimates cited above of jobs supported directly and indirectly by the various parts of the wireless industry, a fraction of the whole is computed for each region based on the local fraction of national employment and economic activity in the telecommunications industry, mobile device manufacturing, distribution and retail, and industries and occupations related to content, applications, and services for online devices. Depending on the local importance of such economic activity, the fraction of total wireless industry-related jobs estimated to be in the local area may be greater or less than the population share of the region. In contrast to the first two types of economic impacts, this estimate of jobs supported is meant to encompass the whole wireless industry ecosystem, not just the incremental impact of 5G. Los Angeles, California The impacts of the 5G network on the economy in Los Angeles are shown in Table 2. The area of economic activity is the Los Angeles metropolitan area.54 Investment of $8.4 billion by the wireless broadband industry will be required to deploy 5G services, which will spur other local industries to invest another $17.8 billion during 2019–2025. Subscribers in Los Angeles will spend about $3.6 billion more on 5G mobile services than they would have on 4G service, given the higher value they will place on the service.55 Consumer spending on 5G devices will total $4.9 billion. While not all of that spending stays in the local economy, about a quarter of a million jobs are created over the study period compared to the 4G-only world, with an average of 35,500 jobs each year. About 95% of the jobs are created by local network investment, investment by other local industries, and local spending on 5G devices and wireless service. The remaining 5% of jobs are created by 5G-related demand for local goods and services coming from outside the region. Workers in these jobs will earn $17 billion total. The 5G-related investment and spending will also create $47 billion in additional sales of output over seven years, adding an average of $4.0 billion of value56 each year to the Los Angeles economy during 2019–2025. Overall, 5G will add $28 billion of value during the forecast period.",23,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

The estimates in Table 2 are above and beyond a counterfactual scenario in which 5G is not deployed in the nation, and 19 in 20 jobs specifically depend on deployment in the Los Angeles area. If regulatory barriers delay local implementation, these potential benefits will be pushed further into the future or lost.  In additional to the new jobs created, 5G services will help sustain existing local jobs related to wireless service in the area. The local wireless ecosystem, including service and infrastructure providers, device manufacturers and sellers, and creators of content, apps, and services for wireless devices, is estimated to directly or indirectly support 95,600 to 200,700 jobs in Los Angeles.57  New York City The impacts of the 5G network on the economy in New York City are shown in Table 3. The area of economic activity is the five boroughs. Investment of $2.4-5.1 billion by the wireless broadband industry will be required to deploy 5G services, which will spur other local industries to invest another $15.5 billion during 2019–2025. Subscribers in New York will spend about $2.2 billion more on 5G mobile services than they would have on 4G service, given the higher value they will place on the service.58 Consumer spending on 5G devices will total $3.0 billion. While not all of that spending stays in the local economy, between 109,700 and 119,500 jobs are created over the study period compared to the 4G-only counterfactual case, with an average of 15,700 to 17,100 jobs per year. Most of the jobs are created by local network investment, investment by other local industries, and local spending on 5G devices and wireless service. However, given the size of New York’s economy, about 4% of the jobs are created by 5G-related demand for local goods and services coming from outside the region. Workers in these jobs will earn $9-10 billion total. The 5G-related investment and spending will also create $23-24 billion in additional sales of output over seven years, adding an average of $2.0 billion of value59 each year to the economy in New York City during 2019–2025.

Summary and Conclusions 5G wireless broadband will be an important part of the workplace of the near future and other parts of the economy. The estimates computed here suggest that during the next seven years, an average of about 1.2 million workers will owe their jobs each year to economic activity spurred by the deployment of 5G networks. Many more will benefit from increased flexibility in labor arrangements, better education, improved productivity, and higher wages. As consumers, those same workers will enjoy the improvements in healthcare technology, transportation, energy, and other aspects of IoT that 5G will usher in. Those improvements will be especially welcome in rural and disadvantaged urban areas, where higher speed wireless broadband will contribute to the well-being of communities by extending and improving broadband access, enhancing healthcare through telemedicine and IoT medical technology, and encouraging general economic development. The most direct impacts on the economy from 5G – the more than $900 billion of GDP expected to be created during the study period – are only the first rising of the 5G wave, not its crest. The figures computed here do not include the broader impacts of how the new technology will create value for local businesses and the nation’s economy through improving productivity, allowing the creation of entirely new goods and services, and improving the welfare of consumers. Also missing from the economic impacts are the undoubtedly huge amounts of consumer surplus (i.e., benefits enjoyed by consumers beyond what they pay for 5G-related goods and services) that will be generated. Three decades ago, few people anticipated how the internet would fundamentally transform so many areas of economic and personal life. In the coming decades, 5G and succeeding generations of wireless broadband and the IoT will likely revolutionize the worlds of employment, production, consumption, and quality of life at least as much.",27,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

"Notes  1 The assistance of Michael Shires and Christina Syriani, both of Pepperdine University School of Public Policy, in the preparation of this report is gratefully acknowledged. 2 Lower frequency and hence larger cell 5G is also possible and may be particularly useful for rural networks, which must cover greater distances (Segan, 2019). 3 Statista, “Internet of Things (IoT) in the U.S.” (Study ID 61733), accessed May 17, 2019. 4 Investment is one of the main components of GDP. Gross private domestic investment in the national economic accounts includes both investment in new fixed assets as well as investment to replace depreciated assets (BEA, 2015).  5 The data on total capex are from USTelecom and are current through 2017. Figures for the last ten years are also from USTelecom and include investment from 2009 through 2018, although only the top six providers are included in the preliminary figures for 2018. 6 The total figure is based on data from USTelecom, which reports figures for the top six providers with a note stating that these companies typically account for 80 to 85 percent of annual broadband provider capital spending. The approximate figure in the text marks up the reported totals in line with those percentages. 7 The estimates are for wireless capex spending by AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Dish, Charter, Comcast, and Altice USA; the latter four cable operators invest in wireless because they have launched or are developing mobile services that rely on MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreements. The figures are from MoffettNathanson LLC, as cited in Baumgartner (2019).  8 Datum is from Table 2.5.5. (Personal Consumption Expenditures by Function) of the National Income and Product Accounts from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and is in current (nominal) dollars. 9 These are gross job gains. The report states that net job creation would be lower because some jobs will be filled by reskilling existing workers, but that the new economic activity “will nonetheless create thousands of new jobs across the industry” (WEF 2017, p.20) 10 This estimate comes from applying the results of Shapiro and Hassett (2012), who looked at 2G to 3G mobile transition, to the 4G to 5G transition, and thus perhaps should be seen as suggestive at best. 11 These figures appear to include all jobs needed to support the new investment effort, not all of which will be newly created positions. The employment figure in IHS Markit (2017) for the US is higher than the estimates computed in this report because of the difference in the years considered and because the former estimate includes certain economic activity (such as additional sales following from capex in industries outside the communications industry) not considered in the present report. 12 See the summary of early studies in Katz (2012). 13 Other studies fail to find uniformly positive effects on employment from broadband availability in some settings. For example, Stockinger (2019) studied the German experience with broadband during 2005–2010 and found that robustly positive effect on employment in Eastern Germany and in Western service establishments, but a small negative effect on Western manufacturing establishments. However, the latter result “turns out to be less robust to changes of the estimated specification” and the author concludes that “[o]verall, the findings suggest that broadband expansion has helped create jobs in firms which use broadband intensely.” 14 The presence of fiber broadband decreases unemployment in an employment zone (a French administrative division larger than a municipality) by an average of 7 percentage points. 15 Mirzamany et al.  (2016) point specifically to the potential roles of IoT applications such as virtual and augmented reality and tactile internet (see note 21) to redefine tele-teaching, tele-mentoring, and virtual classrooms and universities. 16 The authors account for the possibility that the broadband variable is",34,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"and tactile internet (see note 21) to redefine tele-teaching, tele-mentoring, and virtual classrooms and universities. 16 The authors account for the possibility that the broadband variable is endogenous in the regression equation (for example, due to reverse causality between broadband and where knowledge intensive firms choose to locate, which would destroy the causal interpretation of the results), using econometric methodology designed to address the issue where the data indicate that it arises (Mack and Rey, 2014). 17 See Sherman (2018) for a simple description of this phenomenon and Krueger (2017) for formal empirical investigation.",34,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"18 The report states that 3 million jobs (a figure which is presumably heavily rounded) will be created over seven years (Al Amine et al., 2017). Assuming that these are job-years as usual in regional economic analysis, the figure implies about 428,600 jobs each year on average. 19 The estimates computed below imply the creation of 144,059 total direct and indirect jobs each year (on average during the forecast period) from expenditure on construction. However, construction jobs are only 46% of all jobs created from CAPEX spending in the wireless telecommunications industry, and CAPEX spending in that industry accounts for only 25% of all jobs created incrementally by 5G deployment. Thus, the total job figures presented in section IV.B.1 below are many times larger. 20 See Green Econometrics (2015) for further discussion of this point. 21 The tactile internet allows users to interact with a remote or virtual environment in real time, even while on the move. It requires an internet network that combines ultra-low latency with extremely high availability, reliability and security. The haptic interaction with visual feedback can be used to interact with others from afar (the next step beyond mere telepresence), control robots, or even make use of robotic exoskeletons for those with disabilities (Kavanagh, 2018). 22 Given the challenging methodological and data issues involved with measuring productivity at the level of individual firms, it is perhaps unsurprising that some other studies fail to find significant changes in firm performance from broadband. Most such studies focus on areas outside the US, however (e.g., De Stefano et al. (2014), who examined firms in Kingston-upon-Hull, UK in unpublished work, and Haller & Lyons (2015), who investigated the performance of manufacturing firms in Ireland). 23 Their data are for the penetration rate of mobile telecommunications of any sort, not exclusively mobile broadband. However, by the end of their sample period (2007) this measure includes mobile-broadband enabled devices. 24 Prieger (2013) shows that mobile broadband partially fills in geographical gaps in fixed-line broadband coverage in the US. 25 Statista, “Size of the Internet of Things (IoT) market by application in North America from 2012 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars),” accessed May 17, 2019. 26 See PWC (2017), p.9. 27 The forecast is from a May 2018 UBS Q-Series report, “Who will win the race to autonomous cars?” cited in Shah (2018). 28 US Department of Energy, “Annual investment on smart grids in the United States from 2014 to 2024, by technology (in billion U.S. dollars),” accessed May 17, 2019. 29 Statista, “Smart Home revenue forecast for selected countries in the segment Energy Management 2023 (in million U.S. dollars),” accessed May 17, 2019. 30 Statista, “Wearables“, accessed May 17, 2019. 31 For example, cattle can be fitted with a wireless bolus in the stomach for the life of the animal, which can communicate via Bluetooth to an ear tag. See LinkLabs, “An In-Depth Look At IoT In Agriculture & Smart Farming Solutions,” Nov. 30, 2017. 32 Of this revenue, about 67% is from hardware, 29% is from software, and the small remainder is from precision farming services. Statista, “Estimated market value of the precision farming in the United States in 2016 and 2024, by application),” accessed May 17, 2019. 33 The study carefully matches counties with a high level of broadband adoption to observably otherwise-similar counties with lower adoption. This allows causal estimation of the effect of broadband adoption on changes in employment between 2001 and 2010.  34 See Prieger (2015) and the studies cited therein. 35 In their study of the impact of mobile telephony and broadband usage on labor productivity, Gruber and Koutroumpis (2011) show that there are increasing returns in the impact of mobile infrastructure deployment and usage of mobile broadband. Thus, investment in mobile broadband infrastructure would yield more",35,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"(2011) show that there are increasing returns in the impact of mobile infrastructure deployment and usage of mobile broadband. Thus, investment in mobile broadband infrastructure would yield more than proportional increases in income and employment growth, possibly due to the multiplier effects discussed in this section. 36 The latter results are from a separate model of the stochastic frontier production function, an econometric model for ideal “frontier” GDP and the actual gap from it. The specific finding is that a 10% increase in mobile broadband lines per household results in a decrease in the average productive inefficiency by 0.02 points in",35,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"high income countries. This magnitude can be compared to the average total efficiency gap of 0.026 for the US (Thompson and Garbasz, 2011). 37 The study also found that GDP growth further causes additional broadband penetration, leading to a virtuous cycle of growth. 38 Per Ookla, in Q2-Q3 the average fixed broadband download speed in the US was 96 Mbps, the same for mobile broadband was 27 Mbps. Mobile traffic accounted for about 40% of the whole, per Statista, “Percentage of mobile device website traffic in the United States from 1st quarter 2015 to 1st quarter 2019,” accessed May 20, 2019. 39 Instead of the current 27 Mbps average download speed for mobile devices, I assume that 5G speed will be ten times as fast (270 Mbps). This appears to be conservative since many sources say that 5G will be “10 to 100 times faster than 4G.” Furthermore, this speed is only half of what Qualcomm was able to achieve (442 Mbps) in a real-world 5G simulation in San Francisco in 2018 (Gartenberg, 2018). Finally, this assumption is modest compared to the theoretical maximum in the 5G standards of 20 Gbps.  40 Michael Shires (Associate Professor of Public Policy, Pepperdine University) assisted with the estimates from IMPLAN. 41 The spending diminishes as it moves upstream from the originating industry because leakages occur through spending outside the US economy. 42 The resulting number of jobs created may not all be full-time positions, since the employment data that IMPLAN and BEA uses to analyze the employment requirements of the affected industries rely on full-time/part-time annual averages. 43 In the income approach to measuring GDP, value added is the value of income generated from production. This income consists of compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports, and returns on investment (gross operating surplus). In the production approach to measuring GDP, value added is (equivalently) total output less intermediate inputs. National GDP can be calculated as the sum of value added across all industries in the country (BEA, 2013). 44 Earnings include all additional wages, salaries, proprietors’ income, and employer contributions for health insurance. Proprietors’ income includes the net earnings of sole-proprietors and partnerships. 45 Similar studies performed for investment in wired broadband networks and previous generations of wireless networks include Katz and Suter (2009), Atkinson et al. (2009), Eisenach, Singer, and West (2009), Crandall and Singer (2010), Sosa and Van Audenrode (2011), and Prieger (2017). 46 While the public sector will no doubt also benefit from 5G, detailed data on investment outside the private sector is lacking in the national accounts. 47 Details of the regression are in section B of the appendix. 48 Singer et al. (2017) discuss three studies (Atkinson et al., 2009; Katz and Suter, 2009; Pearce et al., 2013) that also find the “spillover jobs multiplier” to be greater than one. 49 This calculation assumes that real GDP will grow 3.2% in 2019 and a conservative 2% per year thereafter. 50 The low figure is from GSMA (2019), after adjusting their North American figures to reflect the U.S. only. The high figure is from Safer et al. (2018b). 51 As with the national estimates, the details of the calculations are in the appendix. 52 The estimates are from ITU (2018); see the appendix for details. 53 Leakages are estimated using data on input-output activity in the regional economies; see the technical appendix for details. 54 As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) includes the counties of Los Angeles and Orange. 55 This figure includes 5G IoT connectivity, which composes only 0.1% of incremental connectivity spending during this period. 56 Value added in a regional context is analogous to the regional contribution to national GDP. 57 See note 50.  58 This figure includes 5G IoT connectivity, which composes only 0.14% of incremental connectivity",36,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

"Appendix This appendix contains the details of the calculations of the economic impacts discussed in the text. All dollar-denominated quantities are in current dollars.68 A. Wireless industry CAPEX 1. Total amount required It is assumed that a total of $225 billion will be spent by the wireless industry on CAPEX for 5G over the study period (2019–2025). This amount includes the 5G edge network, improvements to other parts of the network to handle the additional traffic, and improvements to the 4G network that will eventually be used for or in conjunction with 5G.69 The amount is an estimate that is in accord with or at the low end of several other forecasts: • The Federal Communications Commission (2018, at 2) states that “it is estimated that wireless providers will invest $275 billion over the next decade in next generation wireless infrastructure deployments….” This estimate is based on calculations by Accenture (Safer et al., 2018a). • A study by Analysis Group (Sosa and Rafert, 2019) assumed that deployment of 5G would require $298B over 7 years. They mention other estimates ranging in the literature from $225 billion to over $400 billion, with many estimates falling between $250 billion and $300 billion. • Morgan Stanley estimates that CAPEX for 5G deployment will be $265 billion in the U.S. (Morgan Stanley, 2019). • GSMA Intelligence estimates that U.S. wireless network operators will spend about $100 billion in three years on upgrading their LTE networks and investing in 5G.70 By extrapolation, this figure is in line with $233 billion in 7 years.  • Finally, the largest wireless network providers (AT&T, Verizon, and an assumed merged T-Mobile/Sprint) in the U.S. have announced approximately $115 billion in anticipated CAPEX for 5G deployment in the next few years.71 Total spending by these companies is likely to be much larger because some of these figures appear to pertain to a shorter horizon and do not include mobile 5G, likely do not include upgrades to the wired network complementary to 5G deployment, possibly are understated to avoid alarming their investors, and almost certainly do not include any possible future investment that may be subsidized by state or federal agencies to reach high cost areas. The various sources make differing assumptions about when the CAPEX will be spent. A seven year period was adopted for the analysis here because it is a commonly cited length given for 5G deployment and also because many of the necessary forecasts needed for various parts of the analysis run only through 2025. Some estimates cited above pertain to spending beginning in 2018 while others are later. The present analysis takes 2019 as the first year of the study period; to the extent that some spending occurred earlier, consequent benefits are not reflected in the results",38,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"presented here. Alternatively, the results can be seen as pertaining approximately to the first seven years of 5G investment, whenever it began. To allocate the total spending to particular years, a common assumption is to spread it evenly across years (e.g., Singer et al., 2019). However, other analysts forecast spending to fall after peaking between 2022 and 2024 (Grijpink et al., 2018, Exhibit 4). Thus the analysis here assumes that CAPEX is $36.8 billion in each year 2019 to 2023 before beginning to taper, with $24.6 in 2024 and $16.4 in 2025 (for a total of $225 billion). Finally, note that because of the employment creation from purchases of 5G service and devices, the total economic impacts calculated in the text are not proportional to the wireless industry CAPEX assumed here. For example, if wireless CAPEX were only $115 billion (the extreme lower bound of from the final bullet point above), which is about half of the assumed $225, the estimated jobs created would fall by only 34%. 2. Recipient industries/commodities of wireless CAPEX The main assumptions necessary to convert spending to economic impacts are as follows: 1. Following Prieger (2017), 53.7% of wireless industry CAPEX is assumed to go toward wireless and wired network equipment and fiber, 15.5% is assumed to be spent on engineering, computer, and programming services, and 30.8% is allocated for construction.72 2. Of the amounts allocated to equipment and fiber, the split between the RAN (radio access network) and the core (fiber and wired network equipment) is 66%/34% in 2019 and evolves to 86%/14% in 2025. The movement toward higher spending on RAN reflects the need for increasing densification of the 5G small-cell portion of the network as traffic grows.73  o Spending on RAN is associated with BEA commodity 334220, broadcast and wireless communications equipment. o Spending on the core is split 68%/32% between wired network equipment and fiber optic cable for backhaul and upgrading the wired network to handle additional traffic. The former is associated with BEA industry 334210, telephone apparatus manufacturing, which produces equipment such as routers. The latter is associated with BEA industry 335921, fiber optic cable manufacturing. 3. Spending on engineering, computer, and programming services includes network design work and virtualization of the 5G network. The spending is assumed to be split evenly among BEA industries 541300 (architectural, engineering, and related services), 541511 (custom computer programming services), and 541512 (computer systems design services). The multipliers for these three service industries are relatively similar to each other, and so the exact division of this part of CAPEX among these services is relatively unimportant.",39,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"4. CAPEX spent on construction is assumed to go toward BEA industry 233240, construction of new power and communication structures. 3. CAPEX multipliers The next step toward calculating the multipliers is to determine for spending on manufactured goods (telephone apparatus, wireless equipment, and fiber) how much of each dollar goes toward the manufacturer, how much goes to the wholesaler, and how much for transportation of the manufactured goods. The BEA refers to these as distribution costs; in IMPLAN they are the “margins.” These margins for broadcast and wireless communications equipment are: 87% of spending goes to the manufacturer, 12% to the wholesale industry, and the remainder goes to transportation. For fiber optic cable, the breakdown is 77% to the manufacturer and 22% to wholesale and for telephone apparatus it is 62% to the manufacturer and 35% to wholesale; in each case the small remainder goes to transportation.74 Next, how much of the spending on each item that stays within the domestic economy is determined, versus leaking abroad through the purchase of imported goods. In IMPLAN, these figures are the “local purchasing percentages.” The fraction of domestically produced and delivered goods out of all domestic and imported purchases by industry is found from United States Census Bureau’s Manufacturing and International Trade Report: 2016 and 2015. Matching industries as closely as possible to the BEA categories, the following figures are used: 73% of commodity 334210, 16% of commodity 334220, and 76% of commodity 335921 is domestically produced. The remainder of the spending (the part going to imported goods) disappears from the rest of the calculations.  The multipliers for each spending item, after accounting for margins and local purchasing percentages, were obtained from IMPLAN, where the region of analysis for the national estimates was the United States. The multipliers for employment are: Table 6: Jobs Created Per $1M Expenditure on CAPEX Items IMPLAN Sector BEA Code Industry/Commodity Direct Indirect Induced Total 304 334210 Telephone apparatus manufacturing 2.6 2.2 4.2 9.0 305 334220 Broadcast and wireless communications equipment 0.7 0.6 1.0 2.3 338 335921 Fiber optic cable manufacturing 1.3 2.9 3.2 7.4 449 541300 Architectural, engineering, and related services 5.9 4.4 7.6 17.9 451 541511 Custom computer programming services 4.8 3.5 6.8 15.0 452 541512 Computer systems design services 7.1 2.6 8.9 18.6 54 233240 Construction of new power and communications structures 6.9 2.2 5.4 14.6",40,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"The final multipliers for wireless industry CAPEX are weighted sums of the commodity-specific multipliers and the allocations of CAPEX discussed above. The final multipliers (which vary year to year as the split in spending between RAN and the core changes) and the total jobs created from them are: Table 7: Jobs created per $1M expenditure on wireless industry CAPEX Year Additional CAPEX  ($ billion)  Jobs Multipliers per $1 million expenditure  Total  Jobs  Created  Direct Jobs Indirect Jobs Induced Jobs Total  Jobs  2019 36.8  3.7 1.9 3.9 9.5  349,770 2020 36.8  3.6 1.8 3.7 9.1  333,427 2021 36.8  3.6 1.7 3.7 9.0  330,896 2022 36.8  3.5 1.7 3.7 8.9  329,090 2023 36.8  3.5 1.7 3.6 8.9  327,812 2024 24.6  3.5 1.7 3.6 8.9  218,484 2025 16.4  3.5 1.7 3.6 8.8  144,624          Total        2,034,102 Average        290,586  Direct jobs are those created by the industries receiving directly from wireless industry the spending $1 million of CAPEX. Indirect jobs are those created by the business-to-business purchases and sales in the upstream industries that supply the direct recipients of the CAPEX. The direct and indirect effects are known in input-output analysis as “Type I” effects. Induced jobs are created by household purchases derived from labor income payments throughout all rounds of the impact.75 Total jobs created, therefore, are the sum of the Type I and induced effects (collectively, the “Type II” effects). For example, in the first year expenditure of $1 million creates 3.7 jobs in the industries supplying the wireless industry with capital goods (including the transportation and wholesale industries). To provide those capital goods and services, the supplying industries create another 1.9 jobs in the upstream industries providing needed inputs. The additional labor earnings garnered by workers in all affected industries, when some of it is spent on household consumption, creates another 3.9 jobs. Altogether, 9.5 jobs are created per $1 million expenditure on capital goods and services in 2019. A job in IMPLAN is computed with reference to the earnings multiplier. Given a certain amount of labor earnings created by the economic activity under consideration, as calculated with the earnings multiplier, employment created is computed using the state-level employment-to-earnings ratios that correspond to the relevant industries.76 The industry employment statistics used for the calculations include full- and part-time jobs, and are based on annual averages of monthly job figures, and therefore the final estimate of jobs created have the same average hours of work attached to them as the industries in which they are created. This also implies that one job created refers to one worker for 12 months, 12 workers for one month, or any other combination adding up to one job-year. For this reason, along with the fact that individuals can hold more than one job,",41,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"the number of jobs is not the same as the number of workers benefiting from by the economic activity. From the final column of Table 7, the wireless industry CAPEX creates about 290,600 jobs in the average year.

Nevertheless, due to the other domestic economic activity spurred by the CAPEX, the total output multipliers are all greater than one. B. CAPEX in other industries Many of the jobs created come from CAPEX in private industry outside the wireless broadband industry. Several other studies, recognizing the nature of broadband and wireless technology as general-purpose technologies, include such economic impacts (e.g., Atkinson et al., 2009; Crandall and Singer, 2010; Katz and Suter, 2009; Singer et al., 2017). Instead of ad hoc assumptions about which industries are affected by 5G, the present study measures how investment in all private industry changes in response to investment by the communications industry.  1. The econometric relationship between wireless CAPEX and investment in other industries The estimated relationship rests on econometric modeling of how private investment in fixed assets in the broadcast and telecommunications industry (the most specific industry group of which the wireless communications industry is a part,77 denoted 𝑦""#$$ in the equation below) affects investment in other private industries (denoted 𝑦%& for industry i [other than COMM] in year t) the next two years. The regression equation is:",42,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"𝑦%&=𝛼%+𝛽+𝑦""#$$,&-++𝛽.𝑦""#$$,&-.+𝛾+𝑦#0123,&-++𝛾.𝑦#0123,&-.+𝜀%& where investment is measured in logarithms,78 𝛼% is an industry specific fixed effect to allow the scale of the relationship between the different types of investment to vary across industries (and to account for other industry-specific factors affecting investment otherwise left out of the equation), and 𝜀%& is the econometric error term. To control for general trends in investment and the economy, total investment in industries other than industry i and the broadcast and telecommunications industry is also controlled for (𝑦#0123). The latter variable is included with the same two lags as broadcast and telecommunications investment to ensure that the relationship of interest between one year’s investment in wireless CAPEX and the subsequent two years of investment in other private industry, as measured by coefficients 𝛽+ and 𝛽., is not merely reflecting patterns in investment across all industry driven by (for example) the business cycle. Data on investment in fixed assets by the broadcast and telecommunications industry and 63 other private industries were collected from the BEA for years 1999 to 2017,79 yielding 1,197 observations for use in the regression after accounting for the lags in the specification. The estimated regression equation is:80 𝐸(𝑦%&)	=𝛼%+0.187(0.072)𝑦""#$$,&-+−0.120(0.081)𝑦""#$$,&-.+0.981(0.122)𝑦#0123,&-+−	0.143(0.829)𝑦#0123,&-. where the figures in parentheses are standard errors computed to be robust to heteroskedasticity and clustering on industry. The results from this log-log specification imply that the coefficients are elasticities: a 1% increase in 𝑦""#$$ leads to an average 0.187% increase in private investment in another industry the next year, followed by an average 0.120% decrease in investment the following year. This pattern of increased investment one year followed by a lesser decrease in two years may be due to managers in industry shifting planned investment budgets forward in time, necessitating reduced expenditure the year after. Regardless, the total impact on investment in the steady state is positive, since the increase is larger than the decrease (0.187 – 0.120 = 0.067% increase overall, if nothing else were to change).81 With the inclusion of the industry fixed effects and the controls for investment in other industries, these impacts of wireless industry CAPEX can be interpreted as “other things equal,” net of overall trends in investment, and untainted by industry-specific unobserved factors.  The coefficients reported above, since they are the same for all industries, represent average responses across industry. Some industries, particularly those with greater use of higher technology, may invest more, and others less. However, using the average relationship between wireless industry CAPEX and investment in other industries is appropriate when the results are applied to total other-industry investment, as is done here. 2. Forecasting the increase in wireless CAPEX Section A.1 of this appendix presented the assumed wireless industry CAPEX. Since the regression estimates are in the form of elasticities, the CAPEX amounts must be converted to percentage increases beyond what CAPEX would have been absent investment in 5G.

"turn, requires forecasting what wireless industry CAPEX would be without the additional spending. Given the availability of data, the baseline “no 5G” forecast of CAPEX is computed for private fixed investment in broadcasting and telecommunications. The forecast, shown along with the actual data in Figure 2, is based on an autoregressive integrated time-series regression model.82 The figure also shows historical CAPEX by broadband services providers,83 which makes up a sizeable part of the whole. Figure 2: Estimation and Baseline Forecast for Investment in Fixed Assets in the Broadcast and Telecommunications Industry 
 The amounts of 5G CAPEX from section A.1 above were added to the baseline forecast for investment in broadcasting and telecommunications and the resulting percentage increases were computed. The results are in the following figure. Investment is forecast to be about 20% higher than baseline during 2019 to 2023, when it begins to tail off. It may be argued that the baseline investment in the forecast thus computed is too large; in the absence of 5G perhaps CAPEX in the wireless industry would be well below its trend. To the extent that is true, then the estimates of jobs computed here are understated, for with a smaller baseline forecast and a fixed CAPEX requirement for 5G ($225 billion) the percentage increases in broadcasting and telecommunications investment would be even larger. The present approach is thus maintained as the more conservative choice.",44,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 4. Other-industry CAPEX multipliers The resulting incremental CAPEX in private industry other than broadcasting and telecommunications is reported in the first data column of Table 9. These are the amounts to which the relevant multipliers will be applied. The multipliers for employment (in the middle columns of Table 9) were computed in IMPLAN for generic private CAPEX (investment not including structures).86 Compared to the multipliers in Table 6 for wireless CAPEX there are relatively more indirect and induced jobs created, likely because the CAPEX here does not include construction, for which those multipliers are relatively low.

Spending on 5G connectivity The next category of economic activity spurred by 5G wireless deployment is incremental spending on mobile connectivity.  1. Connectivity for smartphones, mobile PCs, and tablets Forecasting expenditure on 5G mobile connectivity requires forecasting what 5G service revenues for wireless service providers may be, and then subtracting what those subscribers would have spent if 4G were the best available technology. The forecast of 5G-subscribing devices is constructed as described in section D below. The number of 5G subscribing devices is multiplied by an estimate of the difference in average revenue per unit (ARPU) between 5G and 4G service. This procedure does not include any additional revenue from 5G fixed wireless broadband service, which, if included, would create even more jobs. The difference in ARPU is set to be equal to that implied by current prices for 201987 and declines by 15% per annum thereafter. The decay rate of the 5G premium was determined by examining forecasts of ARPU for 4G and 5G service from Strategy Analytics (Bicheno, 2016).88  The resulting incremental 5G wireless service revenue for smartphones, mobile PCs, and tablets is reported in the first data column of Table 11.

"2. Connectivity for 5G IoT  Spending by business enterprises on 5G IoT is divided among IoT hardware, software, professional services, and connectivity. Of these items, the first three are included in the private industry CAPEX forecast (see section B), leaving connectivity to be discussed here. Lacking direct forecasts of connectivity revenue, the following procedure was followed. First, a forecast for expenditure on 5G cellular IoT devices (hardware and software) is taken from Grand View Research,90 which expects such purchases to begin in 2022. Of expenditure on hardware and software, 65% of the forecasted amount is for IoT hardware,91 which allows forecasting of software expenditure.  Spending on connectivity can then be estimated using data from GSMA (2019) covering the proportions of spending on IoT software, professional services, and connectivity.92 The resulting enterprise spending on 5G IoT connectivity is reported in Table 13. The multipliers are the same as in the previous section for NAICS industry 517312. D. Spending on 5G electronic consumer goods The final category is expenditure by consumers on mobile broadband devices: smartphones, computers, and tablets. While there will be other forms of 5G devices, it is easiest to forecast these major items, which will undoubtedly compose the bulk of near-term 5G device sales. As elsewhere in the analysis, only that part of the expenditure that is expected to be greater than the existing 4G alternatives is counted. 1. 5G smartphones Forecasts for the installed base of 5G smartphones through 2024 in North America are available from Ericsson.93 These data were scaled down to include only 5G devices in the U.S.94 To infer the yearly shipments from the data on the installed base, estimation based on queuing theory was performed. The idea behind the estimation is that with assumptions about the probability distributions of yearly purchases and the elapsed time a device is in service, estimates of yearly sales can be backed out from the data on the installed base. That is, using data on how many devices are in use each year, coupled with assumptions about the random processes giving rise to yearly sales and how long people use a device, the number of new device purchases each year can be estimated.95 The results are shown in the figure.96 Table 13: Incremental Revenue for 5G IoT Service and Jobs Created Year IoT Connectivity Revenue  ($ million) Total  Jobs  Created 2019–2021 - - 2022 6.7 51 2023 11.2 85 2024 18.9 144 2025 33.8 258    Total 70.5 539 Average 10.1 76.9 Note: average is calculated for the seven year period.",50,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Out of all smartphones shipped, the fraction forecast to be purchased by business enterprises is about 8% in 2019, decreasing to about 4% in 2025.97 Expenditure by businesses is not included separately in the calculations for employment created, since purchases of 5G devices are included in private industry CAPEX as estimated in section B above.

"E. Wireless industry OPEX There is great variation in the literature, the trade press, and the community of analysts as to what the impact of 5G might be on operational expenditure in the wireless service industry. On the one hand, 5G requires some additional OPEX to fund the power and maintenance requirements of the nodes.108 On the other hand, 5G service is expected to be more energy efficient than 4G LTE, which will reduce that portion of OPEX. Some proponents of 5G claim that there will be massive energy savings from the technology.109 However, any savings per user will be offset at least in part by the increase in the number of microcell sites.110 Furthermore, the energy contribution to technology OPEX is no more than 15%, and technology OPEX is less than one quarter of all telco OPEX (Larsen, 2017). For these reasons, the present analysis assumes that there is no change in OPEX, making the jobs-created estimates more conservative than some other analyses (e.g., Singer et al., 2017). F. Regional calculations 1. Economic impacts from network deployment in the region  For the economic impacts at the regional level, the amount of investment required to deploy 5G was determined using data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU, 2018). That report presents 5G deployment costs for areas of two small areas within an urban setting with different population densities. Using these figures, estimates of the CAPEX required were computed for each Census tract in the regions considered here. The CAPEX amounts were then aggregated across tracts to arrive at a total for each region.  The exact methodology is as follows. From the two ITU (2018) estimates,111 a baseline linear relationship between cost per square mile C and population density X is calculated:  	$𝐶𝑠𝑞𝑚𝑖I=	$𝑎𝑚𝑖.I+K$𝑏𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛IR×K𝑋	𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑚𝑖.IR where C, a = 4.464, b = 1.647×10-4, and X are scalars and the units of each are explicitly stated. From that relationship, cost per person for a Census tract can be computed by dividing both sides by X and its units: U𝐶𝑋V	$𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛I=K𝑎𝑋R	$𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛I+$𝑏𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛I Table 17: Multipliers from $1 Consumer Expenditure on 5G Tablets and Mobile PCs  Economic Quantity Type of Effect Multiplier Labor Income Direct 0.35 Indirect 0.09 Induced 0.21 Total 0.65 Value Added Direct 0.53 Indirect 0.16 Induced 0.37 Total 1.05 Output Direct 0.45 Indirect 0.27 Induced 0.65 Total 1.38",54,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"While still only an approximation of deployment cost, since it is based on only two scenarios, this relationship between population density and deployment cost per capita does reflect the important feature that the latter declines in more densely populated areas, but at a diminishing rate. The result is then multiplied by the number of people residing in the tract, per the 2010 decennial Census figures to arrive at a cost for the tract. An exception is made when the population density is below the density of the lower-density ITU estimate, because it was found that extrapolation of the inverse relationship shown in the equation in that direction resulted in very large cost estimates. For the sake of arriving at conservative cost estimates, the direct estimates from the equation above were replaced with a linear extrapolation based on the slope of the cost relationship at the point of the lower-cost scenario. This is illustrated in the figure, where the slope of the inverse curve at A is continued linearly to the left of the low-density scenario: Figure 8: Extrapolating Deployment Cost Per Person Beyond the Low Density Scenario 
 For New York City only, a range of estimates was computed. The low cost scenario is as described above. The high cost scenario is based on the cost per capita for the entire New York MSA.  Given the amount to be spent locally on CAPEX, the multipliers were constructed as described above for the national analysis. The main differences are the local purchasing percentages (LPPs), which are typically much lower for a city than for the nation; many items will be purchased from suppliers outside the local area. For most commodities, the LPPs were set to reflect typical activity of the relevant kind.112 Due to their nature, certain items such as wireless service and wholesale trade were assumed to be 100% local. For the other items of expenditure, various relevant measures of size were chosen to apportion the national spending to the region. Investment by private industry was apportioned by the ratio of regional to national GDP.113 Mobile connectivity spending and consumer spending on mobile phones, tablets, and computers was apportioned relative to population.114 The estimated regional expenditure in these categories are given in the following table.

Positive spillovers from national deployment Using data from IMPLAN, the spending on investment goods to deploy 5G elsewhere that will leak in to the local area is estimated by the relative size of the local industry. For example, Los Angeles accounts for about 2.6% of the dollar value of output on telephone apparatus (such as network switchgear) manufactured in the U.S. Thus, it was assumed that after accounting for leakage to imports, 2.6% of the remaining spending in other regions on such equipment would go to suppliers in Los Angeles. These figures were adjusted according to the assumptions about LPPs described in the previous section.115 3. Employment in the wireless telecommunications ecosystem To apportion nationwide employment in the wireless telecommunications ecosystem to a region, the jobs were broken down into several categories: infrastructure providers and mobile operators; device manufacturing; distributors and retailers; and content, applications, and services. The national employment in each category is available in the source data. Regional allocations for these were determined as follows: Infrastructure providers and mobile operators First, data on the number of establishments, employees, and annual payroll for wired and wireless telecommunications carriers (NAICS 5171 and 5172) were collected from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns database. Next, the fraction of the whole for the nation was computed for each of these. An evenly weighted average of the local fractions of establishments, employees, and payroll was then computed. This composite allocation factor was applied to the national employment figures for infrastructure providers and mobile operators to arrive at the regional estimate for the initial year of the forecast period. In subsequent years the allocation factor was adjusted in accordance with how local population growth was expected to relate to national population growth. Device manufacturing The initial allocation factor for device manufacturing was taken to be the share of regional output in the nation for commodity 334220, broadcast and wireless communications equipment. These data are from IMPLAN, as described in section 2 above. In subsequent years the allocation factor was",56,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"adjusted in accordance with how local population growth was expected to relate to national population growth. Distributors and retailers The same procedure as for infrastructure providers and mobile operators as detailed above was followed, with the exception that the data are for electronics stores (NAICS 443142) and merchant wholesalers of household appliances, electric houseware, and consumer electronics (NAICS 423620). Content, applications, and services The initial allocation factor is an evenly weighted average of two local shares of the national economy. The first is a local share for the data processing, hosting, and related services industry (NAICS 518210), constructed as described for infrastructure providers and mobile operators as detailed above. The second is the local share of employment in certain relevant occupations related to developers and content creators: software developers, applications (BLS occupation code 15-1132); software developers, systems software (15-1133); web developers (15-1134); producers and directors (27-2012); musicians and singers (27-2042); audio and video equipment technicians (27-4011); camera operators, television, video, and motion picture (27-4031); and broadcast technicians (27-4012).

"Appendix Notes 68 While it is typical to perform economic analysis in real terms (accounting for inflation), nominal figures were used in this exercise because all the source forecasts were in nominal terms and future inflation rates are unknown. In any event, inflation is currently low and is generally forecasted to remain so, and so the distinction between real and nominal figures would be small. For example, the International Monetary Fund forecasts an inflation rate of 2.0% in 2019 and 2.7% in 2020, followed by rates around 2.2% through 2024 (see its World Economic Outlook database). 69 Rossolillo (2019) notes, for example, that even though much of wireless capex in 2019 will go toward the 4G network per se, most of this year’s CAPEX can be considered as “go[ing] to 5G” because “5G builds on top of most components of the existing mobile network (like 4G and fiber optic lines). Spending on 5G wireless equipment will likely be a major source of expense, but building 4G assets and other high-speed wireline connections will need to continue to speed up deployment.” 70 While the report itself is not freely available, the figure cited here is reference in Rossolillo (2019). 71 Overdorff (2018) reports that AT&T announced it will allocate $40 billion of CAPEX for the rollout of 5G wireless network technology. The same source mentions a figure of $35 billion for Verizon, but Arnason (2018) makes it clear that the context for that figure is only for fixed wireless Internet access. In their public interest filing to support their proposed merger, T-Mobile and Sprint committed to “nearly $40 billion” to build a 5G network in the first three years (T-Mobile US, Inc. and Sprint Corporation, 2018). 72 See Prieger (2017) for justification. 73 The figures are taken from GSMA Intelligence (2019). The data in the bar graph there were converted to approximate numbers, accurate to the quantizing of the bars to the pixels in the graphic. 74 These margins are from BEA spreadsheet “Margins_After_Redefinitions_2007_2012_DET.xlsx” and are for 2012 (the latest data available). 75 See https://implanhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009505707-General-Information-About-Multipliers.  76 The earnings multiplier itself is computed with reference to the output multiplier and the industry-level output-to-earnings ratios. For further explanation of how multipliers in input-output analysis are computed, see BEA (2013).  77 The BEA investment accounts group the broadcasting and telecommunications industries, which together composed industry 5130 under the older North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These industries are NAICS 515 and 517 in the 2017 version of the industry codes. 78 While modeling the relationship between the different types of investment in log-log form complicates the analysis below, it is econometrically appropriate given the skewed distribution of private investment (even after controlling for industry fixed effects). 79 See BEA Fixed Assets Accounts Table 3.7ESI, Investment in Private Fixed Assets by Industry. The figures include investment in private equipment, intellectual property products, and structures. The industries included in the regression were the most detailed ones available in the data. For some such as wholesale trade, the industry corresponds to a two-digit NAICS code. Other available industries correspond to three-digit NAICS codes. 80 When estimated by OLS regression with dummy-variable fixed effects, the R2 is 0.963. 81 While the estimated coefficient on the second lag of broadcast and telecommunications investment is not statistically significant, this specification was retained because 1) the first and second lags together are jointly significant, 2) the AIC and BIC criteria both indicate that including two lags is preferable to one, 3) the specification reveals an interesting pattern of adjustments in investment over time, and 4) to be conservative in the estimate of jobs created; the impact is",60,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"two lags is preferable to one, 3) the specification reveals an interesting pattern of adjustments in investment over time, and 4) to be conservative in the estimate of jobs created; the impact is even larger if only a single lag is included (the coefficient in that case is 0.096). 82 The model uses data from 1991–2019 and is an AR(5) specification with integration of order one (and hence is an ARIMA(5,1,0) model).  83 Data on CAPEX by U.S. broadband service providers is from USTelecom (Brogan, 2018). These data include capital expenditures by wireline and wireless telecommunications and cable broadband providers; satellite providers, resellers, and electric utilities are excluded. This CAPEX is lower than total investment in broadcasting and telecommunications because broadband service providers make up only part of that industry segment. 84 The same data and econometric model are used as before (see footnote 82).",60,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"85 Given that the regressors for lagged other-industry investment were included only to control for general business and investment trends during the sample period of the data, those variables were held constant in the computation of how much investment would increase in an industry.  86 The margins and local purchasing percentages for this type of investment were set to the values in IMPLAN’s social accounting matrix, and thus should represent averages across the private economy. 87 At time of writing, AT&T charged a $35/month premium for 5G ($70/month for 15GB of data on its 5G hotspot versus $35/month for 9GB of data on its 4G plan), Verizon charged a $10/month premium for unlimited data, and Sprint and T-Mobile charged no more for 5G than for 4G. Taking the weighted average of these premia, where the weights are the market shares of these carriers (scaled to equal 100%), yields an implied current 5G premium of $15.71/month, or $188.57/year. Data on the market shares of these four carriers (which compose over 98% of subscriptions in the wireless service market) are for Q3 2018 and are from FierceWireless (2018).  88 The data are presented in Bicheno (2016) in graphical form; the data in the line graph there were converted to approximate numbers (accurate to the quantizing to the pixels in the graphic). The original data extend only to 2022 and were extended by log linear extrapolation. The implied ΔARPU declines by about 33% in 2021 (the first year the figure can be calculated using the source data) and about 15% thereafter. The first-year large decline in ARPU is an artifact of the huge 5G premium for the first year of data for 5G in the source; 5G is shown to be more than three times as expensive as 4G (probably because the figures pertain to the global market, not just the U.S.). Given that the present analysis begin with a much more modest 5G price for the U.S. market (only about 1.2 times that of 4G service), the large first-year decline in the premium was discarded and ΔARPU was assumed to decline at 15% per year.  89 The margins for services are 100% for the producers’ value and the local purchasing percentage is 100%. 90 Statista, “Cellular IoT market revenue in the United States from 2014 to 2025 (in million U.S. dollars), by type” (from Study ID 780095), accessed July 18, 2019. The forecast is from 2017. 91 This breakdown is from the summary to the Grand View report. 92 The latter source provides the proportion of total spending on IoT software (apps, platforms, and services), professional services (consulting and software design), and connectivity for each of those three items, but does not forecast the total spending. However, from the proportions, spending on connectivity as a multiple of spending on software can be computed, which then can be applied to the software spending forecast mentioned earlier in the text. 93 Data through 2024 are downloaded from the June 2019 version of the Ericsson Mobility Visualizer, and are for 5G smartphones in North America. 94 The fraction of all mobile subscribers in North American that live in the U.S., 90.8%, is taken from GSMA Intelligence (2019). 95 The assumed model for the installed base is an Mt/M/∞ queuing system, which means that the distribution of units shipped is modeled as a Poisson stochastic process with time-varying parameters, the length of time a unit remains in use before retirement is exponentially distributed, and units enter the installed base immediately upon shipment. The arrival rate for the Poisson process is modeled as the previous year’s rate multiplied by a quadratic function of time; this allows the arrival rate to evolve with a parsimonious specification. The average time in service for a device is taken to be 2.8 years, based on data from Daniel Research Group (2019). With these assumptions, the likelihood function for the four unknown parameters (the three quadratic coefficients and the initial period arrival rate) can be computed and",61,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"Research Group (2019). With these assumptions, the likelihood function for the four unknown parameters (the three quadratic coefficients and the initial period arrival rate) can be computed and maximized, using the results in section 2.3.1 of Prieger (1999). The MLE estimates are then used to compute the Poisson arrival rate each year and thence the expected units shipped.  96 Estimates of units shipped for 2025 are computed similarly to other years (i.e., the expected number of shipments based on the Poisson mean for the relevant year as calculated from the estimated coefficients), but note that the source data only extend through 2024. Thus the final year’s estimates are both forecasts and extrapolations. The same is true of the estimate for the installed base for 2025, which is calculated as the expected value of the installed base given the estimated queuing system. 97 Forecasts of the proportions of smartphones shipped to consumers and enterprises through 2023 are from Daniel Research Group (2019). The forecasts were extended to 2025 by extrapolating the decline in the enterprise proportion. 98 This amount is, e.g., the premium for a Galaxy S10 5G compared to a 4G S10+ in June 2019.",61,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"99 The margins for consumer spending on this commodity are 38% for the producers, 0.4% for transportation, 18% for wholesale, and 43% for retail. The local purchasing percentage is 16.5% for the producers’ value (because most of these items are imported); the LPPs for the other margins are taken from IMPLAN’s social accounting matrix. 100 Data through 2024 are downloaded from the June 2019 version of the Ericsson Mobility Visualizer, and are for mobile PCs, tablets, and routers using any 3G/4G/5G technology in North America. 101 The fraction of all connected devices that are 5G is available only for smartphones in the Ericsson data, and so those fractions were assumed to apply to tablets and mobile PCs as well. The fraction increases from 0.9% in 2019 to 72% in 2024. 102 See footnote 94. 103 During the study period, the fraction of tablets and mobile PCs that are the latter is about 53%, and is forecast to change little during that time (Daniel Research Group, 2019). Data on the fraction for routers was not available, and so it was assumed that they composed a de minimis number of connected device units for consumer purchases. 104 The average lifetime of a tablet or mobile PC is assumed to be 5.6 years, based on data from Daniel Research Group (2019). See footnote 96 on estimates for 2025. 105 Data on the fraction of mobile PCs and tablets that are purchased by businesses are from Daniel Research Group (2019). 106 Adding 4G LTE to a mobile PCs adds about $150 to the purchase price (Hunt, 2018). In first generation 5G smartphones, the 5G chipsets cost about twice as much as for LTE. Thus it is assumed that the 5G premium doubles the cost of adding mobile connectivity to the PC. The logic is similar for tablets, except that adding 4G LTE to a tablet “usually carries a $100 to $150 premium” Piltch (2015), and so an initial premium of $125 is assumed. 107 The margins for consumer spending on this commodity are 63% for the producers, 0.7% for transportation, 18% for wholesale, and 18% for retail. The local purchasing percentage is 13.5% for the producers’ value (because most of these items are imported); the LPPs for the other margins are taken from IMPLAN’s social accounting matrix. 108 Singer et al. (2017) assume a figure of $1,300 per year per node for additional OPEX for 5G. 109 For example, one group of experts early predicted “energy consumption by the whole [5G] network of only half that typically consumed by today’s networks” (NGMN Alliance, 2015, at 4.6.2). 110 One expert, after reviewing data on power savings when using 5G equipment, states: “However, this power efficiency technology and network cellular architecture gain can very easily be destroyed by the massive additional demand of small, smaller and smallest cells combined with highly sophisticated antenna systems consuming additional energy for their compute operations to make such systems work” (Larsen, 2017).  111 In the higher density scenario, it costs $9.58 per square mile to deploy 5G when the population density is 31,080 people per square mile; in the lower density scenario the cost is $5.87per square mile and the density is 8,542 people per square mile. The constants a and b in the equation are determined from these two points. 112 That is, the LPP was drawn from IMPLAN’s social accounting matrix for the region and commodity. 113 The initial apportionment was based on latest available GDP figures. Apportionment for future years assumed that future regional GDP ratios would evolve the same as regional population ratios are expected to change, based on Census Bureau projections. 114 See previous footnote on population projections for future years. 115 For example, since wireless service is assumed to be an entirely local expenditure, none leaks in from outside the region.",62,ACT Ex Parte Notice re 5G Economic Analysis 2020.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

REPLY COMMENTS OF AT&T  
AT&T Services, Inc. , on behalf of its wirel ess affiliates, provides these reply comments on 
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Notice”) issued by the Federal Communications 
Commission (the “Commission”) pertaining to use of partitio ning, disaggregation , and leasing to 
enab le spectrum access by small and rural carriers .1 
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  
The Commissio n released the Notice to explor e the use of partitioning and disaggregation 
of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as means to increase services in rural areas and spectrum 
access by small carriers, as required by the MOBILE NOW Act.2   AT&T supports the 
Commission’s efforts to make spectrum available in unserved and underserved areas and supports 
those comments urging the Commission to meet those goals in part by allow ing for recombining 
of partitioned and/or disaggregated licenses.   Preventing licensees from recombining licenses 
undermines the Commission’s goals and discourages secondary market transactions in the first 
place.  Moreover, AT&T supports those comments urging the Commission to improve its forms

 and databases.  Updates t o those systems would promote secondary market transactions, simplified 
processes, and transparency.  
II. DISCUSSION.  
 
A. AT&T Agrees with Commenters that the Commission Should Allow for Recombining 
of Partitioned and/or Disaggregated Licenses.   
 
AT&T agrees with  commenters that support allow ing licensees to recombine  their 
previously partitioned or disaggregated licenses .  CTIA comments that  permitting licensees to 
recombine licenses would encourag e them “to lease or sell spectrum in the first instance ” while 
also reducing their administrative burdens .3  Google agrees, adding that increased costs from 
administrative requirements for multiple partitioned or disaggregated licenses, such as 
construction requirements, renewal s howing, continuous service requirements, and maintaining 
updated license information, “discourages disaggregation in the first place.”4  As The R Street 
Institute explains, “ [a]llowing market transactions, in any reasonable sense, means allowing these 
transactions to go both ways.  Permitting free reaggregation alongside disaggregation would not 
only allow more flexibility in the use of spectrum over time, it would also incentivize initial 
licensees to participate in the secondary market in the first place. ”5 
There are no unsurmountable impediments to the Commission providing licensees with 
this flexibility.  No Commission rules prohibit the practice of recombining of partitioned and/or 
disaggregated licenses.  And, as the Commission has recognized, the recombining of  partitioned

 and/or disaggregated license can be performed “ by Commission staff under current rules and 
licensing systems.”6  In fact, as CTIA observes, Commission staff has recombined licenses for 
AT&T and Sprint on multiple occasions.7 
 The Commission questions whether allowing licensees to recombine partitioned and/or 
disaggregated licenses would result in the avoidance of construction requirements or “laundering” 
of a licensee’s regulatory obligations.8  Picking up that theme, s ome comme nters discourage the 
Commission from allowing reaggregation and/or propose allowing re aggregation only after a 
licensee meets its construction obligation9 or conditioned on building 100% of the licensed area .10  
These arguments are misplaced.  Licensees of recombined licenses must still meet the original 
construction obligations applicable to the service.  Those licensees do not avoid construction 
requirements any more than other licensees holding licenses in the same service that have not been 
partitioned  or disaggregated  or a licensee that lease d the spectrum instead of partitioning or 
disaggregating  a license .  In all cases, the licensees would  be subject to the identical (i.e., the 
original) construction obligations.  
Moreover, r efusing to reconstitute partitioned and/or disaggregated licenses or delaying a 
recombination until a licensee has met the construct ion obligations for each partitioned and/or 
disaggregated license would undermine the Co mmission’s long -stated goal in partitioning and

 disaggregation contexts —""to ensure that the  spectrum is used to the same degree  that would have 
been required had the partitioning or disaggregation transaction not  taken place. ”11  The 
Commission has obser ved that mandating  separate construction obli gations on disaggregated 
licenses , which is effectively the same a s conditioning reaggregation on completio n of license 
build -out, “could inadvertently discourage disaggregation by imposing a heavier regulatory 
burden  on parties who choose to disaggregate than was required of the original licensee”12  The 
Commission reiterated these principles as recently as 2017, when it re cognized that independent 
performance obligations imposed on both parties to a partition or disaggregation  “might, under 
certain circumstances, unnecessarily impose additional construction requirements  . . . that would 
not have existed had the license not been partitioned or disaggregated ” and instead, decided to 
allow participants to share construction requirement s to “ensure [] that no two parties to a 
partitioning or disaggregation arrangement will be required to build out more than 100 percent of 
the requirement for any particular geographic area or spectrum block.”13 
For these reasons, the FCC should allow licensees to reconstitute partitioned and/or 
disaggregated licenses , up to the size of the original market area.  AT&T acknowledges that 
allowing licensees to recombine licenses might  increase the administrative burdens on 
Commission staff and co mpete with other filings for staff time.14  However, “those one -time 
agency costs should be lower than the ongoing costs of administering multiple licenses .”15  Over

 the long term, reconstituting multiple licenses into the original single license, such as merging four 
WCS licenses into one surviving license, would create an exponential reduction in administrative 
burden by eliminating application filings for perfo rmance showings, renewal showings, 
continuous service requirements, license updates, and the like , for the cancelled licenses .  
Moreover, adopting a simplified format for recombining previously partitioned and/or 
disaggregated licenses and improving Commis sion systems, as discussed below, could minimize 
the strain on administrative resources.   In the short term, t he Commission could substantially 
reduce the potential for a flood of applications to recombine licenses by requiring a heighted 
showing for propo sed license combinations that do not reconstitute the original license area.  
B. Updating the Commission’s Forms and Databases Will Promote Secondary Market 
Transactions . 
 
AT&T agrees with CTIA that the Commission can facilitate secondary market spectrum 
transactions – and promote many other public interest benefits – by upgrading its online forms and 
databases.16  Most spectrum transactions are processed through the Universal Licensing System 
(“ULS”) on Forms 603 and 608.  Neither Form 603 nor Form 608  has been significantly updated 
since first introduced .  ULS, which recently celebrated its 21st birthday,17 contains a treasure trove 
of useful data regarding spectrum licensing and usage but can be improved to be more streamlined 
and user -friendly for lic ensees and the general public alike.  
There are three key benefits the Commission can achieve by performing long -overdue 
updates to ULS and its associated forms.  First, the Commission can ensure that parties to

 secondary market transactions are able to tak e advantage of all the rights and opportunities 
provided to them by the Commission’s rules.  As CTIA notes, there are several ways in which 
ULS (in particular Form 608) does not have the full functionality contemplated by the 
Commission’s rules, which leng thens the processing time for certain transactions and requires 
parties to comp ensate by employ ing burdensome workarounds .18  Second, the Commission can 
upgrade and improve its online forms to streamline actions that are clearly in the public interest, 
such as reaggregation of previously -disaggregated licenses or spectrum swaps that do not 
constitute a spectrum aggregation event for any party.19  Third, by improving ULS the Commission 
can use its data to support public resources that are more user -friendly and that promote 
transparency regarding spectrum licensing.20

 III.      CONCLUSION  
 
By taking the actions discussed above, the Commission can advanc e the partitioning, 
disaggregation, and leasing of spectrum in rural areas, reduce administrative burdens for licensees 
generally, and promote transparency to the benefit of licensees and the general public.

Dear Ms. Dortch,  
 
On September 10, 2020, ACT  | The App Association (App Association) staff  Alexandra Cooke, 
Graham Dufault,  Caitlin Irr, Morgan Reed, Brian Scarpelli, Brad Simonich, Chelsea Thomas,

Chairman Ajit Pai , where the above -noted dockets were discussed . 
 
At the start of the meeting, the App Association described the characteristics of its membership 
and the impact its businesses have as part of a thriving app  economy . The App Association 
represents more than 5,000 app makers and connected device companies located across the 
United States and around the globe that power the global digital economy. Our members  
leverage the connectivity of smart devices to create innovative solutions that make our lives 
better.  Our members provide the touchpoint to the mobile revolution, which continues to create 
new efficiencies across consumer and enterprise sectors, from finance to healthcare to 
manufacturing  to entertainment . The $1.7 trillion app ecosystem is led by U.S. com panies that 
employ more than 5.9 million Americans.  More than 80 percent of the top U.S. app companies 
are located outside of Silicon Valley, with many headquartered in rural areas, and all depend 
on strong broadband to grow and create new jobs.",0,App Assn Ex Parte Notice Pai 091120.pdf,ACT -  The App Association (the App Association) ,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 App Assoc iation members shared their support for Commission progress in making spectrum 
policy changes to enable 5G innovations in America. The App Association has long supported 
and continues to support the Commission’s efforts to bring better broadband to America ns by 
opening more spectrum  and reducing regulatory burdens  for infrastructure deployment , 
including in the Chairman’s new proposal to make the 3.45 -3.55 GHz band available for 
commercial use throughout the contiguous United States .1 App Association econo mic analysis 
shows that deployment of 5G wireless networks will create 8.5 million jobs in the United States 
over the next five years, enabling improvements in economic productivity, employment, and 
consumer value.2 5G will affect the labor market through direct and indirect means; while the 
additional labor required to build out the network to deploy 5G will certainly create the most 
immediate demand for new jobs, the broadest impact on the labor market comes from new  
employment opportunities throu gh the way 5G will enable new applications, services, ways of 
doing business, and general growth of businesses. Workers enabled by this will earn more 
than $560 billion during that time, create $1.7 trillion in additional output, and add over  $900 
billion to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).3 
 
Specifically, the App Association noted its support  for Commission efforts to enhanc e last-mile 
broadband connectivity for Americans through unused television white space (TVWS) 
spectrum bands. Leveraging the TVWS b ands will augment mobile broadband access for both 
U.S. urban and rural markets, bridg ing the digital divide and support new and improved  IoT 
capabilities for consumers and enterprises. The App Association noted its support for 
Commission action to resolve  remaining proceedings to put TVWS rules into place as soon as 
possible, and to resolve such rules no later than the end of 2020 consistent with the 
Commission’s public commitment to do so.4

 The App Association also shared support for the Commission’s efforts to unleash  the potential 
of the 6 GHz band,5 which will also enable grow th and job creation. With new unlicensed 6 
GHz connectivity points representing a crucial use case of efficient wireless connectivity, 
Commission action unleashing 6 GHz technology fully aligns with its overarching goal  of 
advancing  5G deployments.  The App Association urged the Commission to resolve remaining 
issues in 6 GHz band proceedings as soon as practicable  based on a well -developed  record 
(that includes substantial  technical evidence ) indicating that proposed unlicensed use  will not 
result in harmful interference in the 6 GHz bands .6 
 
The App Association further discussed its continue d support for the Commission’s efforts to 
bring better broadband to Americans  through developing be tter broadband maps ,7 consistent 
with requirements in the Broadband DATA Ac t.8 The App Association stressed that more 
accurate and granular maps that can correctly identify unconnected or under -connected areas 
are essential to the Commission accomplishing its mission (e.g., appropriately target ing its 
Universal Service Fund support by deploying broadband infrastructu re to the areas it most  
needed) , and to assist App Association members in business planning and product 
development, particularly for those  based and/or serv ing customers in rural areas that lack the 
robust connectivity needed to support new and innovative internet products and services .  
 
The App Association also discussed its efforts to advance the uptake of digital health 
innovations through its Connected Health Initiative9 and its support for the Commission’s 
efforts to secure broad band connectivity for healthcare. The wide array of connected health 
technology products and services —such as live voice/video telehealth  and remote monitoring 
of patient -generated health data —provide the ability to save countless American lives while 
lowering healthcare costs. The App Association expressed support for the Commission’s 
ongoing efforts to support innovative uses of broadband to address the ongoing COVID -19 
public health emergency in America.10 Further, the App Association urged the Commissio n to 
finalize its proposed Connected Care Pilot Program11 as soon as possible.

Washington, DC 20554  
 
 
COMMENTS OF COMPETITIVE CARRIERS ASSOC IATION  
 
 Competitive Carriers Association (“CCA”)1 respectfully submits these comments in 
response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (“Notice ”) released by the Federal 
Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) seeking comment on how changes to 
its partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules  might increase spectrum access  to close the 
digital divide ,2 as directed by  the Making Opportuni ties for Broadband Investment and Limiting 
Excessive and Needless Obstacles to Wireless Act (“MOBILE NOW Act”).3   
Access to spectrum is critical for carriers to reach unserved and underserved areas  where 
gaps in servi ce often continue to persist .  Policies that provide flexibility to partition and 
disaggregate spectrum will promote opportunities for carriers to acquire spectrum in a particular  
geographic area and enhance  buildout  efforts .  Properly tailored partition and disaggregation  
                                                 
1 CCA is the nation’s leading association for competitive wireless providers and stakeholders 
across the United States.  CCA’s membership includes nearly 100 competitive wireless providers 
ranging from small, rural carriers serving fewer than 5,000 customer s to regional and national 
providers serving millions of customers.  CCA also represents associate members including 
vendors and suppliers that provide products and services throughout the mobile communications 
supply chain.

 rules also will promote  the Commission’s l ong-held goal to provide licensees the “flexibility to 
determine the amount of spectrum they will occupy and the geographic area they will serve.”4    
CCA therefore urges the Commission  to modify  its partitioning, disaggregation, and 
leasing requirements to facilitate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services  
across all corners of the United States .  The Commission  should  streamline the requirements for 
the lease or sale of spectrum , including  for rural and regional providers .  The Commission  also 
should adopt reasonable construction buildout extensions and modified performance 
requirements for partitioned and disaggregated licen ses so that carriers can expand service to 
rural consumers under an attainable  buildout framework .  Finally , the Commission should adopt 
similar relief for providers  offering various types of voice or broadband services , not merely 
common carriers.  These measures will promote efficient use of spectrum and will support the 
deployment of advanced services across the United States . 
I. THE FCC  SHOULD ADOPT INCENTI VES  AND REDUCE REGULATO RY 
BURDENS  TO ENCOURAGE THE SA LE OR LEASE OF SPECTRU M 
 
The Commission seeks comment on whether it should adopt incentives to encourage 
licensees to lease or sell spectrum , particularly  to small or rural carriers.5  CCA supports the 
adoption of such incentives, and agrees that  streamlinin g spectrum sale and leasing procedures  
will help to achieve this goal .  Both the licensee and the licensor can face substantial burdens 
associated with the application process in secondary market transaction s.  In particular, small and 
rural carriers  often  are at a competitive disadvantage if they  do not have the means  necessary  to

 purchase or lease large swaths  of spectrum.  And for larger carriers, the transaction costs of 
partitioning or disaggregating spectrum may deter what would otherwise be a mutuall y beneficial 
lease or sale of spectrum rights.   The Commission should therefore adopt policies that reduce 
procedural barriers  and incentivize  competitive carriers to engage in a spectrum lease or sale .   
 Additionally, as discussed below, modified performance requirements or license term s 
for licensees that buy or lease spectrum would appropriately reflect the realities of deploying 
such spectrum in rural, underserved, and unserved areas, and would incentivize the efficie nt 
allocation of spectrum .  Such changes would promote both the “availability of advanced 
telecommunication services in rural areas” and “spectrum availability for covered small 
carriers.”6   
The Commission also should adopt policies that allow spectrum “r eaggregation” for 
spectrum that has been partitioned or disaggregated on the secondary market.7  CCA agrees that 
holding multiple licenses for what was once a single license may impose certain regulatory and 
administrative burdens on licensees, including c onstruction requirements, renewal showings, and 
continuous service requirements.8  Allowing a provider to consolidate multiple licenses will 
maximize buildout and efficiency.  
II. THE COMMISSION SHOUL D MODIFY PERFORMANCE R EQUIREMENTS 
TO PROMOTE SPECTRUM PARTI TIONING AND DISAGGRE GATION FOR

 in rural areas .”9  In CCA’s vi ew, i mproving  carriers’ abilit y to obtain  spectrum in rural areas  will 
accelerate deployment to these areas, consistent with the goals of the MOBILE NOW Act.10  
Large geographic license areas often result in significant swaths of rural territory  being 
combined  together with more densely populated  urban territory.  Many of the defining 
characteristics of rural areas , such as  “[l]ow population density, low priority in the equipment 
distribution chain, [and] significantly higher construction and backhaul costs ,”11 may make these  
corners more attractive for carriers focused on the unique business cases necessary to deploy in 
these areas .  Policies t hat encourage buildout through license partitioning and/or disaggregation  
will benefit  rural consumers  and aid in the ubiquitous deployment of advanced communications 
services .   
To further promote partitioning and disaggregation  opportunities , the Commission should 
adopt appropriate performance requirements that reflect the realities of deploying newly 
partitioned and disaggregated spectrum , particularly  in rural America .12  While  CCA generally  
support s strong buildout requirements, some flexibility to the requirements discussed in this 
proceeding will help to account for the unique circumstances associated with receiving 
partitioned or disaggregated  licenses .

 The Commission’s proposal “to extend by one year a receiving party’s construction 
deadline for a partitioned or disaggregated license”13 is therefore a sensible solution to  setting 
performance deadlines for such licenses.  The FCC proposes two conditions for this one-year 
extension  to apply : “when (i) the receiving party is a rural carrier or is acquiring spectrum that 
includes ‘rural areas ’ as defined in Section 616, and ( ii) the receiving party elects to meet the 
construction requirement independently for its partitioned or disaggregated license area.”14  CCA 
generally supports these conditions , as they would limit the use of this extension to a reas in need 
of deployment .  The Commission  may, however, need to clarify the second condition in cases 
where the ultimate license holder assists with some of the construction requirement s.  In 
addition, the Commission should consider on a case -by-case bas is whether certain licensees 
receiving partitioned or disaggregated spectrum  should receive a further modified timeline to 
meet buildout requirements.   
CCA also encourages the Commission to apply any extension  to the interim and final 
constru ction requirements ,15 which would ensure that carriers can meet both milestones once 
they have received partitioned or disaggregated spectrum.  Applying an extension to one without 
the other would unnecessarily limit the relief intended to facilitate deploy ment , particularly if a 
rural carrier obtains partitioned or disaggregated spectrum right before the interim buildout  
deadline .  Consistent with proposals in the Notice , the Commission also could limit one -year 
construction extensions to requests filed no later than six months before the construction

 deadline to ensure timely and efficient applications .16  Further, to ensure that license terms 
coincide with the buildout deadlines, CCA encourages the Commission to extend the licen se 
term where  “the final construction deadline is coincident with renewal.”17   
Given the timing constraints that may be present if a carrier receives partitioned or 
disaggregated spectrum in the middle of a license term , extended construction deadlines and 
modified performance requirements , where appropriate, would enable  more rural carriers to 
pursue spectrum in such areas.  Creating realistic timeframes makes  carriers more likely to invest 
in the resources  necessary  to deploy advanced telecommunications services  in hard -to-reach 
areas .  Ultimately,  tailored modifications to the Commission’s existing policies can increase  the 
ubiquitous deployment of reliable  service .18 
Finally, CCA urges the Commission to expand the class of licensees that benefit from 
modified obligations to include licensees  other than merely “common carriers.”  Making this 
change is necessary to serve the MOBILE NOW Act’s purpose of promoting “the availability of 
advanced telecommunications services in rural areas.”19  With a trend towards IP -enabled 
services, providers of mobile voice and broadband may not fall cleanly into the definition of a 
common carrier, but still provide valuable services and need access to spectrum to do so.  
“[S]trictly limiting the benefits and build -out incentives” of partitioning and disaggregation in 
this way would “exclude broadband providers that are not ‘common carri ers’ and provide fewer 
options for larger carriers wishing to disaggregate, partition, or lease spectrum to rural providers”

 or other small providers.20  This, in turn, could stifle some rural consumers’ access to advanced 
telecommunications services.   
III. CONCLUSION  
 
The MOBILE NOW Act directs  the Commission  to promote the availability of 
telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum availability to all carriers , including 
small and rural providers .  To satisfy that directive , the Commission should  incentivize the sale 
and lease of spectrum and reduce procedural barriers to partitioning and disaggregation .  
Adopting the measures discussed above  would advance the goals  articulated in  the MOBILE 
NOW Act  and would increase deployment of advanced telecommunications  services to all 
corners of the United States .

 Comments of  the Am erican Petroleum Ins titute  
 
Dear  Ms. Dortch :  
 The American Petroleum Institute (“API”), submits these brief comments in response to the Commission’s above reference Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on proposals to encourage spectrum leasing, partitioning, and di saggregation of spectrum to small entities.  
API supports the Commission’s efforts to make more intensive use of existing spectrum resources.  
 
API member companies  operate large telecommunication networks, many of  which are wire less 
in nature. These private wireless solu tions are necessary because as Critical Infrastructure (CII), 
our members operate in areas where commercial wireless servi ce may be inadequate or non-
existent .  Spectrum covering these areas often is actually assi gned to licensees, however, because 
licenses are typically allocated according to large service areas, rural and remote areas remain 
underserved even while urban areas receive service. Consequently, API members support simple partitioning, disaggregation, or l easing rules that provide incentives for reasonable spectrum  
options, especially in rural areas.  This would help accelerate digitally transforming the O&G 
industry by enabling remote capabilities and faster data transport.  
 
 Based on the NPRM, API off ers the following input:  
 
1) Although the MOBI LE NOW act does not include CII entities, such as API ’s members, in its 
definition of “Covered S mall C arrier”, we believe it is in the public interest for the 
Commission to include CII as a beneficiary of incentiv es to encourage partitioning, 
disaggregatio n, or leasing. 
 
CII entities are pursuing the use of many of the same core technologies used by Covered Small C arriers, albeit with different service objectives.  These objectives bring advanced James Crandall

"telecommunications  to enterprise facilities and industrial IO T devices, instead of consumer 
products.  However, these operations , including those of Oil &  Gas companies and u tilities, 
are critical to rural area s for many economic as well as safety reasons. Consequently, rules 
that promote the use of RF spectrum to i mproves the effectiveness and reliability of CII 
operations are consistent with public interest in these areas.   
 
2) API believes the Commission should provide a positive incentive for  larger carriers /licensees 
rathe r than punitive consequences to stimulate t he lease of unused spectrum at a reasonable 
rate. A reward of bidding credits, or the ability of smaller entities  to buy discounted bidding 
credits and transfer them to larger licensees as payment for  spectrum sal es, may prove a more  
effective incentive.  
 
Our membership has reported that efforts to acquire spectrum from major telecommunication 
carriers have not be effective due to several factors. Some reasons include : 
 a) Encumbrance. A r eluctance  by the carriers  to encumber their unused spectrum based on 
competitive matters .  Large carriers are often reluctant to even discuss sale of their 
spectrum holdings.  When they do, transactional terms frequently seek to retain an unacceptable high level of control in the carr ier (for example, the right to terminate a lease 
if the carrier determines the spectrum is necessary for its operations).  
b) High Cost. An unreasonabl y high cost valuation  associated with rural spectrum that is 
based on P ops/MHz pricing established for large urban areas.  
c) Transactional Costs. T he high level of overhead associated with these transactions versus 
the benefits to the licensee.   Carriers are not in the spectrum sale and leasing business and 
the costs of entering into and managing such transactions i s not seen as a core business 
objective.  
 
Any incentive we feel the Commission offers must address these concerns to be effective.  
 3) With  regards to  modified or reduced performance requirements, we believe the Commission 
needs to certify  the lessee’s build plan meet s a “reasonable standard” for the leased/partitioned 
area when the Commission  approves the arrangement . Otherwise, API feel s that the ability to 
meet a reduced performance requirement may be abused.  
 Having the build requirements pre -approved for  the leasing/partitioning arrangement would 
also guarantee that the original spectrum owner’s interest in the spectrum will be far less at risk, since  any reduced leased area buildout requirements  will be understood for the separated 
area. While there woul d be subjectivity in appro ving the actual requirements , we feel that this 
would allow the Commission some needed flexibility, especially for remote areas.  
 4) Finally, API feels that a long- term solution to the unused spectrum availability is for the 
Commissi on to offer smaller lice nse areas initially , including spectrum at the sub- County 
level . This will allow spectrum in the primary market to be better targeted to those entities that 
will put it to good use. This proactively “ pre-partitioning” licenses prior  to auction may better 
serve today’s spectrum marketplace  and enable more varied use cases.",1,API Partitioning 19-38-Comments.pdf,API - The American Petroleum Institute,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"API urges the Commission to  consider our suggestions in order to make it more likely that CII 
entities  including API’s O&G members , will be able to  make cost -effec tive use of unused 
spect rum through leasing, disaggregation, or spectrum partitioning .

Database systems and other modern spectrum management tools can be used to enable quick, low-cost, automated transactions, thereby reducing transaction costs and speeding the transfer of spectrum assets. The Commission additionally can encourage greater participation in secondary markets by both potential spectrum lessors and potential lessees through policies such as permitting reaggregation, extending performance deadlines, and promoting opportunity zone programs. If lower transaction costs and enhanced incentives fail to spur the performance of secondary markets, however, stronger action in the form of “use of share” requirements for spectrum licensees would be warranted to align the obligations of spectrum holders with the interests of consumers.  I.Secondary Markets for Spectrum Have Not Reached Their Potential. While the Commission rightly has relied on spectrum auctions and unlicensed spectrum designations to create new wireless access opportunities, it also has sensibly sought to enable secondary markets as a means of putting otherwise-unutilized spectrum into use. As Marcela Gomez, Martin Weiss, and Prashant Krishnamurthy observe, secondary markets hold promise “as a means to correct possible inefficiencies resulting from the primary market and an alternative for carriers to respond to changing technologies and market conditions.” Secondary markets could “help alleviate 4spectrum scarcity by making underutilized spectrum held by current licensees readily available to new uses and users, hence promoting the development of novel and more 4 Marcela Gomez ​et al.​, ​Improving Liquidity in Secondary Spectrum Markets: Virtualizing Spectrum for Fungibility​, Feb. 26, 2019, at 2, ​available at http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/36013/1/TCCN%20Gomez%202019.pdf​ (​Gomez Paper​). 2",3,2019-06-03 Google Comments (WT 19-38).pdf,GOOGLE LLC,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

The secondary market has been relatively helpful in allowing established carriers to expand or consolidate their spectrum holdings. For instance, a 2013 study of the Commission’s Universal 7Licensing System database conducted by Mobile Future found that 89% of MHz/POPs assigned or transferred on the secondary market went ​to​ major wireless providers or between non-nationwide providers.

"Google Comments WT Docket No. 19-38 June 3, 2019 Carriers often hold surplus spectrum due to the Commission’s preference for large geographic license areas with long license terms in licensing available spectrum, in order to reduce transaction costs for large operators and the Commission itself. 9Recently, in adopting policies favoring large license areas, the Commission specifically anticipated that private, secondary market transactions would overcome the inefficiencies resulting from aggregating spectrum into larger units for auction. 10However, historically, that has not occurred. Auction winners have not placed surplus spectrum on the secondary market at all, or at least not on terms desirable to potential buyers.  The rarity of secondary market transactions that benefit smaller operators can be seen in the Commission’s records. Mobile Future found that in the ten-year period from January 1, 2003 to May 31, 2013, out of a total of 5,081 applications granted by the Commission for assignment, transfer, or lease of mobile broadband spectrum, only 32.42% of MHz/POPs assigned or transferred, and only 24.29% of MHz/POPs leased, 9 ​For instance, in its recent rulemaking on the 3.5 GHz CBRS band, the Commission increased the size of Priority Access License areas from census tracts to counties, and extended the license term from three to ten years with the possibility of renewal. ​See In the Matter of Promoting Investment in the 3550–3700 MHz Band​, Report & Order, 33 FCC Rcd. 10598, ¶ 7 (2018) (​CBRS Order​). ​See also In the Matter of Expanding the Economic and Innovation Opportunities of Spectrum Through Incentive Auctions, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd. 6567, ¶¶ 18, 37 (2014); ​In the Matter of Use of Spectrum Bands Above 24 GHz For Mobile Radio Services et al., ​Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 31 FCC Rcd. 8014, ¶¶ 17, 82, 121 (2016);​ In the Matter of Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band et al.​, Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 33 FCC Rcd. 6915, ¶ 149 (2018) (​C-Band Order​).  10 ​See, e.g., CBRS Order​ ¶ 97 (asserting that where the Commission has “decided to license the 3.5 GHz band in larger geographic areas for longer, renewable license terms . . . secondary market transactions will allow licensees and the marketplace to determine the correct size of licenses on a market-specific and needs-based basis”). 4",5,2019-06-03 Google Comments (WT 19-38).pdf,GOOGLE LLC,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

"Google Comments WT Docket No. 19-38 June 3, 2019 Potentially larger acquirers of spectrum, like Comcast, are among those noting “high transaction costs [in secondary markets] that often limit the potential for partitioning and disaggregation to result in an ideal allocation of spectrum rights.” Lowering transaction 25costs for market participants therefore could prove effective in catalyzing secondary markets. Transaction costs in secondary spectrum markets take several forms. Simply finding what spectrum resources are available is often a challenge for potential buyers. As OECD noted, availability of information, “by frequency and geographical locations, is important for prospective buyers of spectrum.

Spectrum exchanges powered by databases could draw on actual usage information submitted by licensees and lessees in accordance with Commission rules, and be algorithmically programmed to recognize priority 39spectrum rights and/or sharing rules, as well as possible complementary uses. Furthermore, licensees interested in placing additional spectrum in the secondary market could provide the exchange administrator with information for inclusion in the database, such as protection/availability criteria or conditions like a term of years or other reversion criteria under which the licensee could retake the spectrum. Entities interested in finding spectrum on the secondary market would query the exchange to find a “match.” Using information from the database, the exchange would present viable frequencies.

Additionally, the Commission should consider following regulatory counterparts abroad and deregulating some lease transactions entirely.

For instance, as seen in stock markets and e-commerce, databases could enable automated transactions to support large spectrum orders, making markets simpler and less expensive for small businesses and innovators. This would allow entities to carve out more specialized roles in the wireless telecommunications marketplace, reduce the need for vertical integration to provide end-to-end services, and support innovative business models. In particular, database mechanisms enabling microtransactions for spectrum as well as other necessary inputs could allow entities to focus on what they do best, such as building new facilities, providing high-quality services, and/or subscriber acquisition and management.

Successful secondary markets rely on the presence of adequate incentives to motivate participation both by holders of unused spectrum and potential users of that spectrum.

The Commission should allow reaggregation of spectrum partitioned or disaggregated on the secondary market, up to the size of the original market area. Current Commission rules do not provide a means to reaggregate spectrum, even when previously partitioned or disaggregated portions of an original license area are acquired by a single entity. Holding and maintaining multiple licenses 43for what was formerly a single license increases costs for licensees, “including construction requirements, renewal showings, continuous service requirements, and the need to maintain up-to-date information in ULS.” This discourages disaggregation in 44the first place. As Sprint Nextel noted in 2010, “Allowing consolidation of previously partitioned and/or disaggregated licenses will simplify the administration, tracking and use of geographic area licensing information for licensees, the Commission staff and the public.”  45To the extent that possible manipulation of disaggregation and reaggregation to evade regulatory construction deadlines is a concern, the Commission could condition reaggregation on building out the entire reaggregated service area.

Rather, as the Commission itself recognized in its ​CBRS Order​, performance requirements can encourage licensees “to make timely and productive use of their licenses, and to the extent they choose not to do so, will incentivize them to make . . . spectrum available to others through secondary market transactions.”  48Nevertheless, some flexibility in meeting build-out requirements could encourage secondary market activity by better positioning secondary users to help licensees meet the terms of their authorizations. For instance, the Commission could adjust performance deadlines based on the length of secondary usage, with reasonable time limits and mandatory attestations confirming the arms-length nature of the secondary transaction, to avoid “gaming” of buildout obligations.

V.“Use or Share” Would Be a Particularly Effective Response if Lower Transaction Costs and Enhanced Incentives Do Not Stimulate Secondary Markets.   Should enhancing the efficiency of secondary transactions and increasing incentives for such transactions fail to spur spectrum holders to make their unused frequencies available for productive operations, the Commission should take stronger action. The reasons for holding back excess spectrum resources, even after these changes have been implemented by the Commission, could range from mere inertia to a desire to suppress new competitors or innovations.

In this scenario, implementing a “use it or share it” rule would stimulate spectrum supply and prevent waste. Until such time as a licensee itself uses the spectrum, the Commission could require a licensee to make its fallow frequencies available on a secondary basis. Dynamic spectrum databases could be used to automate the process, enabling time- or geography-limited opportunistic use of spectrum pursuant to Commission rules. To implement this more efficient regime, licensees would be required to provide usage information for their authorized spectrum to databases, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections. When a potential user seeks spectrum, availability could be determined quickly and easily through those databases in a manner that protects the licensees' commercially sensitive information. “Use it or share it” could yield particularly meaningful results in rural and other underserved areas where there are “frequency blocks that the current licensees are not using productively – and that they may never build out, for economic reasons.” In 51addition to promoting the use of currently underutilized spectrum, moreover, “use it or share​ ​it” would provide the Commission with more reliable data about the aggregate volume of unused spectrum, particularly if “frequencies are available for opportunistic use up until such time as a licensee or lessee actually builds out and commences 51 Michael A.

The threat of ceding spectrum does not “by itself enable use of fallow spectrum in the communities that are among the last to be served – even assuming that the licensee will ultimately comply.” If a licensee does not see an economic reason to build out to a 53portion of its license area, due to factors like high costs or the perception of low demand, then the threat of losing that portion of its spectrum portfolio would have little impact on that licensee’s behavior. Instead, opting for “use it or share it” could lead to both employment of otherwise unused frequencies and potential new business opportunities for market stakeholders. For instance, rural licensees under a mandate to “use it or share it” may become motivated to identify potential partners for new business ventures. The Commission also could build incentives or procedures into its “use it or share it” model that would enable secondary market spectrum users to take over frequencies permanently. For instance, the Commission could create a “first-in” preference for spectrum lessors to obtain authorizations to use frequencies ceded by licensees, whether voluntarily or due to lack of buildout.

REPLY COMMENTS OF CTIA  
 
 CTIA  respectfully submits these reply comments in response to the  Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (“ NPRM ”) released by the Federal Communications Commission  (“Commission”) 
in the above -referenced proceeding .1 
I. INTRODUCTION. 
 The initial comments in this proceeding highlight  the importance of secondary market 
transactions and their ability to increase access to spectrum by small and rural carriers and  to 
close the digital divide.   As CTIA  discuss ed, the Commission  can further promote the 
availability of advanced services in rural areas and  increase spectrum availability for rural and 
small carriers through modest revisions to its partitioning, disaggregation, and spectrum leasing 
rules .2  CTIA continues to support the reforms discussed in its initial comments , but files here to 
focus on two specific issues.   
First, a s CTIA and others  state , the Commission should permit , but not require, licensees 
to reaggregate, as a procedural matter, previously partitioned or dis aggregated licenses.  
Allowing spectrum reaggregation would reduce the administrative burdens on licensees that 
choose to partition or disaggregate their licenses and then re -consolidate their holdings, which, in 
turn, could encourage those licensees to le ase or sell their spectrum in the first instance.

"2  Second, the Commission should reject calls for use -it-or-share- it licensing mechanisms.   
Adopting broad use -it-or-share -it mechanisms  would not only undermine licensees ’ existing 
investments , but could also threaten the deployment of next -generation wireless services .  The 
Commission should likewise reject proposals for wholesale application of  automated databases  
because those databases are still being developed and, even when potentially vi able, would not 
likely be as effective in ensuring the efficient deployment of spectrum as flexible, exclusive- use 
licensing.  
II. THE COMMISSION SHOULD ALLOW LICENSEES TO REAGGREGATE 
SPECTRUM THAT HAS BEEN PARTITIONED OR DISAGGREGATED.  
A. The Record Confirms That  the Commission Should Permit, But Not Require, 
Licensees to Reaggregate Previously Partitioned or Disaggregated Licenses.   
 Commenters agree with CTIA that requiring licensees to hold multiple licenses for what 
was once a single license may impose regulatory and administrative burdens, including by 
requiring licensees to comply with multiple construction, renewal, and continuous service requirements.
3  As CTIA noted  and others observe , those burdens can deter licensees from 
engaging in secondary market tr ansactions in the first instance.4  To further incentivize licensees 
to engage in secondary market transactions, the Commission should assure licensees that they may reaggregate their licenses if and when all the pieces of the license are once again held b y the 
licensee.
5  Such clarification  would encourage secondary market transactions at the outset

5 As CTIA noted in its initial comments, the Commission need not adopt a rule to effectuate this result, as 
the Commission has appropriately recognized that spectrum reaggregation may  be implemented by 
Commission staff as a procedural matter.  CTIA Comments at 14 -15.",1,190701 CTIA Reply Comments on Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing NPRM.pdf,CTIA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"3 because licensees would be assured that , if they re -acquire spectrum holdings later, their burdens 
will be no greater than had they not partitioned or disaggregated th eir licenses in the first place.    
 While GeoLinks claims that allowing large carriers to reaggregate their spectrum 
holdings will not help promote  the goal of increasing access to spectrum b y small and rural 
carriers,6 the exact opposite is true.   Large carriers hold many individual licenses , and per -license 
regulatory burdens are multiplied further when licensees are required to hold even more licenses 
that once comprised a single authorizat ion.  To the extent those burdens can be reduced, 
licensees will have a greater incentive and opportunity to partition or disaggregate their spectrum 
holdings at the outset , benefitting small and rural carriers .  As Google states , allowing 
reaggregation “c ould enhance the fluidity of spectrum holdings and thus make secondary 
transactions more attractive for all  parties.”7   
B. Concerns That Allowing Licensees to Reaggregate Their Spectrum Holdings 
May Result in the Avoidance or Gaming of Construction Requirements are Unwarranted and Should Be Dismissed.  
 The Commission should reject  the claims of the few  commenters that argue reaggregation 
would encourage carriers to circum vent construction requirements .  The W ireless Internet 
Service P roviders A ssociation (“WISPA”) , for instance, argue s that allowing larger carriers to 
reabsorb the licenses “would potentially lead to gamesmanship by larger carriers, i.e ., using an 
unaffiliated small or rural provider as a middleman to convey spectrum indirectly from one large 
carrier to another.”
8  It is unclear, however, how WISPA’s assertion relates to spectrum

"4 reaggregation.  Reaggregation allows the same  licensee to reconsolidat e the pieces of an original 
license—it would not, by  itself, result in a large carrier using an unaffiliated small or rural 
provider as a middleman to convey spectrum to another  large carrier.   And, in any case, there  is 
no prohibition on large carriers en gaging in spectrum exchanges with one another, provided such  
exchanges are otherwise consistent with the Commission’s rules and policies.9  
 The R ural W ireless A ssociation (“RWA”)  also states  that rea ggregation would enable 
large carriers to avoid construc tion obligations and engage in spectrum warehousing by 
partitioning undesirable spectrum but later reaggregating that same spectrum.10  However, a s 
CTIA previously explained, the Commission already addressed these concern s in its  2017 WRS 
Order , and clarifying that a licensee may  reaggregate its spectrum would not  change that result .11  
As the 2017 WRS Order  made clear, reaggregation of a license would result in only one license 
with one overall buildout obligation spread across the originally authoriz ed license—i.e. , the 
licensee’s coverage requirements would be the same as if it had never partitioned or 
disaggregated its license in the first place .12   
                                                 
9 For similar reasons, the Commission should also reject WISPA’s call for a minimum holding period for 
partitioned or dis aggregated licenses.  See WISPA Comments at 8.  Such a requirement could have the 
effect of inhibiting carriers from engaging in spectrum swaps, one means by which carriers can acquire 
the spectrum they need to build out networks and deliver communications  services.  Such swaps allow 
spectrum to be put to efficient use and, moreover, can allow a carrier to obtain a contiguous block of spectrum to enable enhanced network performance and numerous other efficiencies.  A mandated holding 
period would hamper the  ability of carriers to engage in these beneficial transactions and prevent entities 
who most want to build o ut the spectrum from acquiring it, undermining Congress’s and the 
Commission’s goal of promoting the availability of advanced telecommunications se rvices, particularly in 
rural areas .

"5 Moreover, the Commission’s actions in the 2017 WRS Order  ensure that a license’s 
original  buildout  deadlines are met .  If reaggregation of a license occurs after  the performance 
deadline, then the buildout would have already occurred in the partitioned area and there would 
be no way to manipulate the construction requirements .  On the other hand, i f reagg regation 
occurs prior to the performance deadline, then the licensee would be required to meet the precise 
obligation imposed on the original license.  
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD PRIORITIZE FLEXIBLE, EXCLUSIVE- USE 
LICENSES OVER SHARING REGIMES.  
 Some commenters  suggest licensees should be subject to use -it-or-share -it mechanisms , 
coupled with or without  onerous database requirements , in order to encourage secondary market 
transactions and prevent spectrum  warehousing.13  However, exclusive -use licensees already 
have strong incentives to make efficient use of their spectrum, including by engaging in 
secondary market transactions .  Because policies supporting exclusive -use licenses have been 
key to driving the efficient and succes sful generations of wireless ne twork s that American 
consumers and businesses enjoy today , the Co mmission should disregard suggestions to adopt 
use-it-or-share -it mechanisms and instead focus on promot ing flexible, exclusive -use licenses . 
A. Regulatory Certainty Included in Exclusive -Use Licenses Creates Strong 
Incentives for Licensees to Use Spectrum Efficiently.  
 As CTIA has previously explained, f lexible, exclusive -use licenses are the cornerstone of 
the U.S.’s successful wireless strategy .14  Not only do exclusive -use licenses provide license es 
                                                 
13 See, e.g., WISPA Comments at 7 -8; Google Comments at 17- 19; Comments of Dynamic Spectrum 
Alliance, WT Docket No. 19- 38, at  4, 7- 11 (filed June 3, 2019) (“DSA Comments”); Comments of Open

"6 with the predictability and certainty necessary to assure them that their investments will be 
protected against harmful interference, but they  also allow  licensees to fully “mine” the 
spectrum, resulting in more intense and efficient utilization .  Indeed, on a MBs/MHz level,  U.S. 
wireless providers have increased their spectrum efficiency by a factor of 42 since 2010 by taking steps such as actively refarming existing spectrum holdings, quickly putting new spectrum 
to use, and deploying iterative ge nerations of technology that increase spectrum efficiency .
15 
  In addition to facilitating greater wireless innovation and investment, the  spect rum 
efficiencies associated with exclusive- use licenses can enable licensees to  create additional 
capacity  within  their existing spectrum resources.  The resulting potential  excess  capacity , in 
turn, may encourage licensees to offer spectrum resources to others, including to small and rural carriers.  The Commission should recognize these  benefits  associated with exclusive -use licenses 
and maintain that approach when adopting proposals in this proceeding.  
B. Wholesale Application of a Use -it-or-Share -it Framework Would Undermine 
Existing Investments.  
 While sharing frameworks may be necessary  in certain cases, they should not be pursued 
as a primary means of encouraging efficient spectrum use or secondary market transactions.   
First, use -it-or-share- it regimes undermine the rights of licensees and the investments they have 
made.   Licensees will purchase spectrum at great cost only with the understanding that they will 
have exclusive use of the license for the duration of the license term.
16  Eroding those rights

industry has made more than $253 billion in capital investments since the launch of 4G in 2010 and has 
contributed more than $116  billion to the U.S. Treasury through investment in spectrum licenses since the 
first spectrum auction in 1994).",5,190701 CTIA Reply Comments on Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing NPRM.pdf,CTIA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"7 could deter licensees from investing  in resources to purchase and deploy spectrum, whi ch could 
have the effect of limiting  the deployment of spectrum in unserved and underserved areas and  
reduc ing the pool of spectrum that may be used in secondary market transactions.  
 Second, use -it-or-share- it mechanisms disregard the technical complexities of deploying 
commercial wireless  equipment and services.  While carriers have every incentive to move 
quickly to deploy new and innovative services, the testing of equipment and services before 
commercial launch typically involves a multi- year process.   Requiring carriers to account for the 
fact that they may be forced to share their spectrum at some point during their license term 
would upend this process and threaten the deployment of next -generation services.17  For 
example, forcing licensees to share could require stringent power or geographic limitations that would inhibit 5G deployments.  It could also introduce equipment incompatibility issues for 
spectrum bands that are used internationally for 5G because other countries are focused on 
providing e xclusive -use spectrum access for wireless  services.
18 
 Third, use -it-or-share -it regimes ignore the difficulty in ensuring  that users vacate 
spectrum when necessary.   Carriers need certainty with respect to when, where, and how much 
spectrum they can use.19  The uncertainty surrounding if a band will be cleared when needed, 
whether for the initial launch of services or for expanding services, makes it difficult for carriers

"8 to engage in spectrum planning and deployment.  While the D ynamic S pectrum A lliance 
(“DSA”)  suggests that use -it-or-share -it rules will be coupled with “the assurance that users will 
not interfere with licensees and will in fact vacate the spectrum as needed once the licensee 
commences service,” DSA also acknowledges tha t this assurance is “conceptual []” at best.20  
There is no guarantee that users will vacate licensees’ spectrum when asked.  And  removing a 
user from spectrum after it has overstayed its welcome is much more difficult than preventing that user from accessing spectrum in the first instance.  
C. Use-it-or-Share -it Rules That Include the Deployment of Automated 
Databases are Untested and Would Take Substantial Time to Develop. 
 DSA and others suggest that “[t]he Commission should employ automated databases —
similar to the soon -to-be-deployed Spectrum Access System (SAS) in the 3.5 GHz Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band—that can be  used to identify usable spectrum, maintain 
detailed network information, and coordinate between different users and priority rights.”
21  The 
Commission , however, should reject these proposals .   
At this time, there has been no real -world deployment of a successful system with 
dynam ic spectrum usage and sharing.22  While the CBRS  mechanism (using a SAS) may hold 
promise —and the wireless industry looks forward to its use for initial commercial 
deployments —the underlying software and equipment surrounding that approach is still nascent 
and unproven.  Even  if SAS -type approaches turn out to be viable, the Commission should not 
consider such methods as the default approach for the sharing of spectrum.  As explained above,

and secondary market transactions. 
IV. CONCLUSION.  
 CTIA applauds the Commission’s efforts to further increase access to spectrum by small 
and rural carriers through its partitioning, disaggregation, and spectrum leasing rules.  To achieve 
this goal, CTIA urges the Commission  to permit (but not require) lic ensees to reaggregate their 
previously partitioned or disaggregated spectrum licenses  and to prioritize exclusive -use 
licensing mechanisms  over use -it-or-share- it licensing regimes .  Doing so would not only 
encourage secondary market transactions , but would also promote the efficient use of spectrum 
to the benefit of  carriers of all sizes.

COMMENTS OF CTIA 
 CTIA1 submits these comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(“NPRM ”) released by the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”) requesting 
input on whether it should establish a program, or modify existing programs, for the partitioning, 
disaggregation, and leasing of spectrum licenses in order to help close the digital divide and increase access to spectrum by small and rural carriers.
2    
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  
CTIA appreciates the Commission’s ongoing efforts to close the digital divide and to 
increase access to spectrum by small and rural carriers through its partitioning, disaggregation, and spectrum leasing rules.  As the NPRM  points out, there have already b een thousands  of 
Commission -approved secondary market transactions that have provide d small and rural carriers 
access to spectrum.   Moreover, nationwide and regional carriers continue  to expand their rural 
footprints, not only improving the scope and speed of their coverage in rural and high -cost areas, 
                                                 
1 CTIA – The Wireless Association®  (“CTIA”) ( www.ctia.org ) represents the U.S. wireless 
communications industry and the companies throughout the mobile ecosystem that enable Americans to

"2 but also creating additional opportunities for those carriers  to engage in secondary market 
transactions  with small and rural providers within their expanded footprints .   
While nationwide and regional carri ers remain committed to partnering  with small and 
rural providers , driven by marketplace forces , the Commission can and should take additional 
steps to reduce any remaining friction in its partitioning, disaggregation, and spectrum leasing 
processes.  Spec ifically, the Commission should:   
• Remove any barriers to secondary market transactions , including by streamlining the 
approval proce sses for leases and transfers.   
• Create greater incentives for providers to enter into secondary market transactions , 
including by extending  for one year the final buildout requirements where a party 
engages in certain secondary market transactions and by permitting licensees to 
reaggregate their previously partitioned or disaggregated spectrum licenses .   
• Modernize its i nformation t echnology (“IT”) infrastructure , including by                
(1) updating  its forms  for assignments, transfers, and leases; (2) providing  licensees with 
the technical means to reaggregate their licenses through a simple and consistent process ; 
and (3) consider ing making licensing information in its Universal Licensing System 
(“ULS”) more transparent by reviving its Spectrum Dashboard  so that interested parties 
have the information they need in a clear and usable manner to enter into secondary market transactions . 
By taking these steps, as described in more detail herein, the Commission can foster an 
even more robust secondary market, thereby increasing deployment in rural areas and facilitating  
the ability of small carriers to access critical spe ctrum resources.   
II. RURAL WIRELESS COVERAGE CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IS FACILITATED BY SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  
The Commission  seeks comment on what, if any, changes to its partitioning, 
disaggregation, and spectrum leasing rules would promote the availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas or spectrum availability for covered small carriers.

"3 Licensees currently engage in secondary market transactions, and r ural wireless coverage has 
been  expanding through multiple marketpl ace forces and government programs.  Those forces  
are expected to intensify as wireless providers continue to improve their networks and more 
spectrum is brought to market .   
A. Rural  Coverage is Expanding Through Multiple Marketplace Forces and 
Government Programs . 
Wireless service providers have made significant strides in expanding coverage in rural 
areas, providing rural Americans with greater choices in innovative wireless technologies.4  As 
the Commission recently reported, approximately 98 percent of al l Americans and 90.9 percent 
of rural Americans had  a choice of at least three Long Term Evolution (“LTE”)  service providers  
last year —a 6.7 percentage point increase from the previous year.5  Regional and nationwide 
carriers alike have also begun testing and deploying 5G services.6 
 This positive trend is likely to continue as both regional and nationwide  providers  
continue  to expand their rural footprints.  T -Mobile, for example, has deployed its 600 MHz 
spectrum to provide LTE coverage in rural areas, ac tivating this spectrum in more than  1,254 
cities and towns across the U.S . and laying the foundation for nationwide 5G .7  This effort

that were previously unser ved by its 700 MHz spectrum.8  AT&T, through its fixed wireless 
Internet service offerings and its contract with FirstNet, is  also enhancing rural connectivity and 
reports that it is committed to filling rural coverage gaps.9  In addition, regional provide rs like 
East Kentucky Network and Bluegrass Cellular are investing in rural areas across the country, 
improving the scope and speed of their coverage.10   
 There are also numerous examples of the Commission’s secondary market policies 
successfully fostering the deployment of wireless services in rural areas and providing access to spectrum by small carriers.  For example, as the Commission observed, AT&T, through New Cingular Wireless PCS, LLC, has disaggregated Broadband Personal Communications Ser vice 
(“PCS”) C Block spectrum to Coral Wireless LLC.
11  T-Mobile  has likewise partitioned its 
Broadband PCS A Block  license to FWC Communications Inc.12  And Verizon has partitioned 
its 700 MHz A Block license to Texas Energy Network, LLC.13  Verizon has also partnered with 
small and rural providers through its LTE in Rural America program, which has allowed small

 The Co mmission has  recognized  that there is an active secondary market for spectrum 
leases and partitioned and disaggregated licenses, including transactions involving small and 
rural entities .  Indeed, it previously rejected claims that small entities are unable to participate in 
secondary market transactions.15  To the contrary, t he Commission note s in the NPRM  that, over 
the last ten years, it has received more than 1,000 assignment applications involving partitioning 
and disaggregation and more than 8,000 spec trum lease applications.16   
The Commission’s upcoming Mobility Fund Phase II (“MF -II”) auction will further 
encourage investment and deployment in rural areas, including through the use of secondary 
market transactions.  The MF -II auction will make availab le up to $4.53 billion in support over 
ten years to primarily rural areas that lack unsubsidized 4G LTE service.17  Not only will the 
Commission allow recipients of MF -II support to lease spectrum in order to provide  the required 
services, but it will also allow applicants to make their spectrum leases contingent on winning 
the support ,18 providing carriers the incentive they may need to enter into secondary market 
transactions to serve rural areas  even if they are not certain they will be auction winners .

"6 B. The Marketplace is the Best Mechanism Through Which These Efforts Can 
Be Supplemented . 
 The Commission should recognize that the marketplace is the best mechanism through 
which efforts by industry and the Commission can be supplemented.  In areas where providers 
are unable, or find it economically infeasible , to provide service, they have incentives to engage 
in secondary market transactions with small or rural providers who have the ability to provide that service.  Instead of generating no revenue from an area they may not serve , nationwide  and 
regional  providers may instead  choose  to sell or lease their spectrum in that area to small or rural 
providers .  Not only does this enable the original provider to realize the value of the spectrum, 
but it also serv es customers who may be underserved or unserved.  As Verizon has noted, the 
Commission need not  “compel[] licensees to enter into private, commercial transactions” with 
small and rural providers because  it can, and does, rely upon “market forces and economic 
incentives to drive spectrum to its most beneficial public use.”

III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO 
SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES 
THAT ENCOURAGE MORE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO SPECTRUM.  
The Commission seeks comment on whether its  existing secondary market rules are 
sufficiently flexible to incentivize licensees to sell or lease their spectrum rights.20  It further asks 
whether the agency’s spectrum leasing rules requiring Commission consent  to an application 
prior to consummation deter such transactions.21  Although, as noted above and in the NPRM , 
wireless service providers engage in secondary market transactions today, reducing procedural

"7 burdens and creating additional flexibility in the C ommission’s rules could further facilitate 
secondary market transactions to the benefit of smaller carriers, particularly in rural areas.  
A. The Commission Should Eliminate Unnecessary Impediments to Spectrum 
Leasing . 
The Commission should consider condensing  and reforming the many rules governing 
spectrum lease approvals into a simple rule that requires , in most cases,  only that the 
Commission receive prior notification —rather than Commission approval —of a spectrum 
lease.22  Simplifying the regulatory processe s for licensees and lessees  would allow for more 
efficient and faster lease transactions and would more promptly promote the public interest by  
permitting “additional spectrum users to gain ready access to spectrum” for the provision of new 
and diverse services.23   
In the alternative , if the Commission maintains  those provisions of its current  spectrum 
leasing paradigm  that require  prior approval , the Commission should ensure that its “immediate 
approval procedures” apply to all  spectrum lease filings that meet the eligibility requirements 
specified in the Commission’s rules.24  As the NPRM  acknowledges, t he Commission’s rules  
provide that applicat ions that meet certain criteria will be eligible for immediate processing by

transfer leases (either through prior notification or immediate approval proced ures) in instances where the 
parties demonstrate ( e.g., via certifications) that they qualify for such immediate approval procedures and 
the transaction does not raise any competitive concerns.  As discussed below, the Commission should 
preserve its current ability to evaluate competition and spectrum aggregation for de facto  leases.",8,190603 CTIA Comments on Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing NPRM.pdf,CTIA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"8 the Commission,25 allowing parties to proceed with their transaction the next day.  However, as 
CTIA members have explained, some applications are “offlined” and subject to more 
cumbersome “general approval procedures”  even when they qualify for immediate processing.26  
For example, applications may be “offlined” if related applications have been filed with other 
bureaus  or offices, or  if not all licenses associated with the application have been fully 
constructed .27  In addition, applications may be “offlined” if some aspect of the application ( e.g., 
identity of the applicant, the spectrum being applied for, or the type of license being sought) 
flags the application for placement  on the Co mmission’s internal “Alert L ist.”28  These unwritten 
reason s create regulatory uncertainty and result in unnecessary delays  in getting spectrum to  
market , ultimately harming potential consumers.29   
The Comm ission should remove this uncertainty and ensure that transactions having no 
impact on competition can be granted as expeditiously as possible.  Indeed, as the Commission 
recognized  in adopting a unified license renewal standard, “[a]  clear, consistent sta ndard will 
promote the efficient use of spectrum  resources and will serve the public interest by providing 
licensees certainty. ”30  CTIA emphasizes that it does not propose any changes to the

"9 Commission ’s “immediate approval procedures. ”  It merely request s that applications that 
qualify for immediate processing, in fact, receive immediate processing.   
CTIA also cautions that, in making any changes to the Commission’s spectrum leasing 
rules and/or procedures, the Commission should preserve its current ability to evaluate 
competition and spectrum aggregation for de facto  leases .31  Long -term de facto transfer leases 
give lessees effective control over valuable spectrum resources , including by serving , in some 
cases,  as interim mechanisms  that lead  to permanent  control over the spectrum.  The 
Commission should therefore retain its ability  to evaluate the competitive impact of a lease ,32 
which could involve, for instance and as discussed below, revising questions on the applicable 
form to ensure that only  applicat ions that warrant review under the Commission’s general 
approval procedures are appropriately offlined for that review .33 
B. The Commission Should Streamline the Processing of Certain Secondary 
Market Transactions.  
The Commission should also streamline the app roval process for simple block- for-block 
spectrum swaps within the same  footprint .  These transactions do not change  a provider’s overall 
spectrum portfolio in its geographic footprint and  therefore do not raise any competitive 
concerns.34  In addition, for  spectrum swaps involving parties that were already Commission 
licensees, the Commission will have previously assessed their qualifications  to hold 
authorizations , thereby ensuring that the licenses are issued only to qualified entities .35

"10 Importantly, block -for-block spectrum swaps  allow providers to harmonize their spectrum 
holdings and create greater spectrum contiguity , which can  enhance providers ’ network 
performance as parties seek to deploy wider channels to support mobile broadband services and 
increase the quality of services that they  provide to their  customers .36  It also produces  greater 
spectrum efficiencies that  may create the additional capacity that will make  providers more 
inclined to offer spectrum resources to  small and rural carriers.   
In light of these benefits, the Commission should consider changing its rules and/or 
processes to ensure that applications for simple block- for-block spectrum swaps receive  pro 
forma  treatment , requiring only prior notice to the Commission and not approval .37  Delaying 
these transactions by otherwise subjecting them to  unnecessarily burdensome review  offers no 
public interest benefits and inefficiently limits the use of spectrum.  
IV. TO FURTHER PROMOTE RURAL DEPLOYMENT AND ENCOURAGE 
SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTI ONS , THE COMMISSION SHOULD 
ADOPT APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES.  
The Commission seeks comment on potential modifications to its performance 
requirements for partitioned or disaggregated licenses —including, for example, by extending by 
one yea r a receiving party’s construction deadline for a partitioned or disaggregated license —in 
order to increase service to rural areas.38  Pursuant to its directive under Section 616 of the 
MOBILE NOW Act, the Commission also  asks about  incentives that may be ap propriate to 
encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that 
will serve rural areas, including by permitting the reaggregation of previously partitioned or

"11 disaggregated licenses.39  While wireless servi ce providers are actively engaged in secondary 
market transactions, and the procedural changes  suggested above can facilitate those 
transactions, the Commission can further encourage licensees to lease or sell spectrum to small 
or rural carriers by impleme nting sensible, market -based incentives.  
A. The Commission Should Briefly Extend Final Buildout Requirements for 
Certain Partitioned and Disaggregated Licenses.   
Smaller  carriers and carriers that seek to serve rural areas  may be deterred from entering 
into secondary market transactions later in a license term if there is limited time to fulfill 
performance obligations.  As a result, that spectrum may go unused even though the receiving 
party could have satisfied the performance obligations  shortly after the deadline.   Thus, CTIA 
agrees that when a transaction occurs late in a license term —e.g., within one or two years of the 
construction deadline —the Commission should afford the receiving party a brief extension of 
one year  to fulfill the construction obligations.  CTIA , however, also agrees that grant of the one -
year extension should be limited to requests filed no later than six months before the construction 
deadline in order to prevent the filing of a transaction and ext ension request late in the 
construction period merely to avoid the loss of a license.40     
A brief extension will provide receiving parties the necessary relief that will promote 
rural deployment.  For instance, if  after partitioning or disaggregation, a r eceiving party has  built 
out a portion of a license in a rural area, but is  unable to fully satisfy  the performance obligation 
by the standard performance deadline, an extension may  enable them to cross the  finish line.   
Allowing the provider to do so in a n extended term wo uld produce a better result than the

"12 Commission’s recapture of the partitioned or disaggregated license, which would leave the 
already -covered population unserved or with reduced service options.   
In addition, recapturing a license area instead of allowing a receiving party more time to 
meet performance requirements would risk allowing the spectrum to lie fallow as it sits in the Commission’s inventory awaiting re -auction —a process that  can sometimes take several years .  
For instance, it took more than three years for the Commission to re-auction licenses in the 700 
MHz band on which winning bidders  defaulted .
41  The public interest would be better served if 
the Commission , in certain instances,  provides more time to meet final performan ce 
requirements rather than permit the spectrum to remain fallow in inventory . 
B. The Commission Need Not Reduce the Substantive Performance 
Requirements for Small Covered Carriers in Rural Areas.  
Although the temporal incentives described above could be  bene ficial in facilitating 
secondary market transactions and rural buildout, the Commission need not , as it suggests,  
substantively adjust the performance requirements ( i.e., reduce buildout requirements) applicable 
to partitioned or disaggregated licenses.42  Allowing a later licensee to meet reduced coverage 
requirements would be inequitable because, had the Commission reduced the coverage 
requirements for the initial licensee, that  provider may have been able to meet the reduced 
requirements in the first instance.   Moreover, the goal of the Commission’s reforms in this 
proceeding should be to ensure that receiving parties secure spectrum to provide a robust level of service, especially in rural areas.  W hile affording  providers more time  to satisfy  performance

"13 requirements may achieve that goal , reducing performance requirements would benefit only the 
receiving party ; it would  do little to help close the digital divide.  
Declining to substantively reduce performance requirements for partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses would likewise align with the Commission’s goals in its proceeding 
implementing a unified regulatory framework for the Wireless Radio Service s—i.e. , to 
ensure that  the original  construction obligation is satisfied.   As the  Commission e xplained in 
that proceeding, “[t]he goal of our construction requirements in both the partitioning and 
disaggregation contexts is to ensure that the spectrum is used to the same degree that would 
have been required had the partitioning or disaggregation tr ansaction not taken place.”43 
C. The Commission Should Permit, But Not Require, Reaggregation of 
Spectrum That Has Been Partitioned or Disaggregated on the Secondary Market.  
To further incentivize  parties to enter into secondary market transactions, t he 
Commission should permit , but not require, licensees to reaggregate previously partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses.
44  As the Commission observes, there is no specific provision in its  rules  
or procedures  for reaggregating  spectrum, even when the partitioned or disaggregated portions of 
an original license are acquired by a single entity.45  And holding multiple licenses for what was 
once a single license may impose certain regulatory and administrative burdens on licensees,  
including construction requirements, renewal demonstrations , continuous service requirements,

from engaging in secondary market transactions at the outset.  Assuri ng licensees that they may

so—if and when the whole license is once again held by the licensee will encourage  licensees  to

Importantly, as discussed below, the Commission need not adopt a rule to effectu ate this

whether, and how, a partitioned or disaggregated license can be reconstituted as a matter or

Not only would a llowing the consolidation of previously partitioned and/or disaggregated 
spectrum encourage secondary market transactions, but it would also reduce costs and burdens 
on licensees, the Commission, and the public associated with tracking and managing multiple licenses.
50  This is  particularly true for licensees that may have thousands of licenses to monitor 
and track.51     
Contrary to the Commission’s assertion, allowing spectrum reaggregation would not 
result in the avoidance of construction requirements or “ laundering” of regulatory obligations.52  
The Commissio n addressed the “laundering” of construction requirements i n its 2017 WRS 
Order .  In that proceeding , the Commission explained that a licensee could avoid its obligations 
by disaggregating a small slive r of its license and assigning the buildout requirement for the 
entire  license to a third -party licensee.53  The Commission  therefore adopted unified buildout 
requirements for spectrum that is partitioned or disaggregated so that parties to a transaction ar e

"16 either individually or jointly held accountable for buildout requirements , thereby eliminating the 
ability for parties to “game” their obligations .54   
Allowing a licensee to reaggregate its spectrum would not  change that result .  Indeed, 
reaggregation  of a license would result in only one  license with one  overall buildout obligation 
spread across the originally authorized license —i.e. , the licensee’s coverage requirements would 
be the same as if it had never partitioned or disaggregated its license in the first place.  As noted 
above, t his is consistent with the Commission’s objective to ensure that the original  buildout 
requirements a re met.55  If the Commission had instead intended only for each piece of a 
partitioned or disaggregated license to meet a  separate buildout requirement, it would not have 
provided licensees the option for each entity to meet its own performance obligation.  Moreover, if reaggregation occurs after performance requirements are satisfied, then any concerns regarding gaming the system will be eliminated.  
CTIA recognizes that additional Commission resources may be necessary to process 
reaggregation applications.
56  However, resource efficiencies would be gained  after  licenses have 
been reaggregated, including  in fewer  buildout, renewal, and continuity of service showings for 
consolidated licenses.  Moreover, additional administrative efficiencies could be achieved if the 
Commission adopts the technical revisions that CTIA proposes below.

"17 V. THE COMMISSION SHOULD UPGRADE ITS IT INFRAS TRUCTURE AND 
ENSURE THAT LICENSEE INFORMATION IS ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT 
TO FURTHER FACILITATE SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  
The Commission seeks comment on whether , in addition to substantive barriers, there are 
procedural barriers to partitioning or dis aggregation that limit the utility of those programs for 
covered small carriers.57  The Commission also asks whether there are procedural barriers to 
leasing that inefficiently limit the use of the program by spectrum licensees.58   
In addition to the substantive barriers discussed  above, t he Commission’s technical

comply with the Commission ’s rules.  First, the Commission should ensure that subleases may 
be submitted electronically.  While the Commission’s rules indicate that FCC Form 608 must  be 
submitted electronically in some instances and may  be submitted electronically in other 
instances,61 Commission practice has required manual filings in certain cases , including for 
subleases .62  Requiring manual filing s is an outdated and inefficient practice  that can 
unnecessarily delay the deployment of new services .  Allowing the electronic submission of 
subleases would not only eliminate unnecessary paperwork requir ements for licensees and 
lessors, but it would also reduce processing delays and ease administrative burdens for Commission staff , ensuring that parties to such transactions promptly deploy their operations . 
 Second, the Commission should update its FCC Form 608 so that interested parties can 
use it to assign their leases and convert their short -term leases to long -term leases.  The

"19 Commission’s rules currently allow parties to engage in both types of leasing arrangements, but 
FCC Form 608 does not include the functionality to allow them to do so.  Consequently, lessors and lessees end up performing inefficient workarounds that often require multiple filings  where a 
single filing theoretically would suffice, or submitting a manual filing.
63  Implementing 
functionality that would permit the conversion of a short -term lease to a long -term lease, the 
assignment of leasing arrangements, or any other task that may be required or contemplated by the rules but missing in FCC Form 608, would reduce co nfusion and eliminate the inefficient, 
interim workarounds  that providers must utilize .   
 Third, the Commission should allow spectrum manager lessees to use FCC Form 608 to 
make necessary filings that do not require involvement or action by the lessor and do not affect 
the underlying license.
64  These filings should include, but should not be limited to, 
administrative updates, notifications of pro forma transfers of control affecting the lessee, and 
necessary compliance filings.  Alternatively, the Commiss ion should amend its rules to clarify 
that spectrum manager lessors are required to act in good faith to assist lessees with any required filings and that lessees will not be responsible for any rule violations that arise from the lessor’s failure to coope rate in good faith.  As AT&T has explained, adopting  either of these approaches 
would limit the opportunity for licensees to prevent  lessees from complying with applicable laws 
                                                 
63 See AT&T 2018 Biennial Review Reply Comments at 7- 8 (explaining that the only way for 
parties to convert a short -term de facto  transfer lea se to a long -term de facto transfer lease is to “file an 
application for a new long- term lease (even though the lease in question is not ‘new’) and then, when the 
new lease application is granted, cancel the old lease”).  
64 See id . at 8 (noting that licensees are required to make filings on behalf of spectrum manager 
lessees, even if only to correct typos and even though the lessee could face regulatory consequences if the 
licensee does not submit the required filings in a timely m anner, because ULS does not currently allow 
lessees to make any  electronic filings related to their leases lest de facto  control of the license shifts  to the 
lessee).",20,190603 CTIA Comments on Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing NPRM.pdf,CTIA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"20 and/or rules, while ensuring that de jure or de facto  control of the leased spe ctrum does not pass 
to the lessee in contravention of the Commission’s rules and policies .65 
 Finally, for both FCC Forms 603 and 608, the Commission should ensure —through the 
addition or elimination of certain questions on the forms —that applications eligible for overnight 
processing actually  receive overnight processing . 
B. The Commission Should Establish a Mechanism By Which Licensees Can 
Easily Reaggregate Their Spectrum Holdings.  
As discussed above, CTIA supports allowing the reaggregation of licenses  that have been 
partitioned or disaggregated.  Allowing reaggregation create s greater incentives for licensees to 
engage in secondary market transactions and can be implemented without any changes to the 
Commission’s rules.  While, as n oted above, current Commission processes have permitted  
licensees to reaggregate their spectrum holdings , those processes vary and have been applied 
inconsistently.  Consequently , staff review of applications to reaggregate licenses often takes a 
substantial amount of time.  Rather than maintain an ad hoc  approach to reaggregation, the 
Commission should adopt a simple, uniform process by which licensees can  easily and quickly  
notify Commission staff that a  licensee has reaggregated its license.   
C. The Commission Should Facilita te License Information Transparency, 
Consistent with Existing Information Collections. 
Finally, to further facilitate secondary market activity, small carriers and carriers seeking 
to serve rural areas should be able to more readily ascertain from the Comm ission information 
about licenses and spectrum holdings.  National and regional wireless service providers remain committed to providing spectrum resources to small and rural carriers.  Nevertheless, it is often unclear from ULS  where such providers hold s pectrum.  Small and rural carriers in particular 
                                                 
65 See id . at 8.",21,190603 CTIA Comments on Partitioning Disaggregation and Leasing NPRM.pdf,CTIA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"21 may lack the resources and expertise to extract the information they need from the Commission’s 
database.  The Commission should therefore consider, as it continues to modernize ULS, ways to 
make licensing i nformation already available in its database more accessible to small and rural 
carriers.   As Commissioner Rosenworcel has noted, partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing will 
work better if “secondary markets can operate with full information.”66   
 CTIA emphasizes that the Commission, in making license information more transparent 
to the public, need not create a new database.  The Commission could, for instance, simply  
revive the S pectrum D ashboard that was created as a result  of the 2010 National Broadb and 
Plan.67  Recognizing that the Commission’s rules often contain technical language and terms of 
art that may be difficult for the general public to understand, the Commission created the Spectrum Dashboard as a “one -stop shopping” portal for licensing information by combining the 
information currently available on separate electronic databases and filing systems into one  
dashboard.
68  It displayed that licensing information to the public in plain language and 
employed a user -friendly mechanism for interest ed parties  to browse licenses by licensee name, 
spectrum band, and geographic area.    
 Whatever mechanism it utilizes, the Commission should not  require any additional 
information from licensees.  The Commission need only ensure that the information available in 
the dashboard relates directly to the information that is already available in ULS and is updated

VI. CONCLUSION. 
CTIA welcomes the Commission’s evaluation of  how its secondary market policies can 
increase deployment  in rural areas and facilitate the ability of small carriers to access spectrum 
resources.  While the Commission’s current rules and policies have fostered an active secondary 
market, the Commission can f urther streamline its processes, reduce substanti ve and procedural 
barriers, and update its IT architecture to encourage even greater access to spectru m by small and 
rural carriers .

NTCA–The Rural Broadband Association (“NTCA”)1 hereby submits these Reply 
Comments for consideration by the Federal Communications Commission (the “Commission”) 
pertaining to possible methods of increasing incentives for large carriers to partition, 
disaggregate or lease spectrum to small and rural carriers, as required by the MOBILE NOW Act 
(“Act”).2  The record reflects nearly unanimous support for establishing rules that would incent 
large license holders to partition, disaggregate or lease unused spectrum to small, rural carriers 
and several commenters pointed to rules the Commission already has in place to help ensure

 spectrum is not warehoused, which could be used as a basis for creating similar rules in response 
to the instant proceeding.3 
I. A DATABASE COULD BE A USEFUL TOOL BUT THAT ALONE WILL NOT 
ACT AS AN INCENTIVE FOR LARGE CARRIERS TO SELL SPECTRUM TO 
SMALL, RURAL CARRIERS  
 
Commenters proposed a number of methods of creating incentives for large carriers to 
partition, disaggregate or lease unused portions of their spectrum to small, rural carriers 
interested in serving the remaining areas.  NTCA encourages the Commission to utilize any and 
all methods to ensure unused spectrum does not lay fallow or is used solely for the purpose of 
swapping spectrum with other large carriers when needed to gain Commission consent to acquire 
new licenses.4   
One solution recommended by several commenters was for the Commission to establish a 
database that would allow licensees to enter locations or spectrum where the licensee would be 
willing to partition, disaggregate or lease certain areas.5  The database would ideally make it 
easier for potential buyers/lessees to identify available spectrum,6 an issue raised by several 
commenters.7  While NTCA agrees that a database could be helpful in identifying available 
                                                 
3 See, e.g., Comments of Federated Wireless, Inc., WT Docket No. 19-38, at 4 (filed June 3, 2019) (noting 
that the Commission implemented a database of available spectrum in the Citizens Band Radio Service) 
(“Federated Wireless Comments”).

 spectrum, licensees still must have an incentive to sell or lease unused portions of their spectrum, 
especially to small, rural providers.  CTIA, by contrast, asserted that licensees already have 
incentives to engage in secondary market transactions with small or rural providers in areas 
where they “are unable, or find it economically infeasible, to provide service.”8  If this were 
often the case, however, the Commission would not be undertaking the instant proceeding.   
One method of providing an incentive for large carriers to partition or disaggregate 
unused portions of their spectrum to small, rural carriers, as suggested by Google, would be to 
grant large carriers who partition or disaggregate a portion of their licensed area to small, rural 
carriers a limited extension of time in which to meet the applicable buildout requirements.9  As 
CTIA noted, the extension should be limited to one year from the final construction deadline and 
carriers would have to request the extension no later than six months prior to the construction 
deadline.10  Furthermore, to ensure the disaggregated or partitioned licenses are placed in the 
hands of small, rural carriers who have the ability and incentive to build out areas historically left 
unserved by the larger providers, NTCA recommends the extension apply only in instances 
where the licensee demonstrates it has entered into an agreement to partition or disaggregate a 
portion of the licensed authorization to an entity that qualifies for a rural service provider bidding 
credit pursuant to the Commission’s rules.11

 II. THE COMMISSION’S RULES MUST ALSO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
 SMALL, RURAL PROVIDERS TO ACQUIRE PRIMARY SPECTRUM  
 
While creating rules that will provide more opportunities for small, rural carriers to gain 
access to secondary spectrum is helpful and necessary, access to spectrum on a primary basis 
remains at once critical and at the same time a thorny issue to resolve.  Therefore, NTCA 
continues to encourage the Commission to develop rules that will spur opportunities for small, 
rural carriers to acquire both primary and secondary spectrum.12  NRECA likewise 
recommended the Commission offer a bidding credit to rural service providers, such as that 
offered in the 600 MHz auction.13  The Rural Wireless Association also emphasized the need to 
“mak[e] it easier for small, rural carriers to successfully bid on spectrum at auction without the 
need to wait years to lease or purchase this very same spectrum….”14 
In an attempt to place more spectrum in the hands of small, rural carriers, several 
commenters encouraged the Commission to implement “use it or share it” rules, whereby 
licensees would be required “to provide usage information for their authorized spectrum to 
databases,” so that another provider could utilize the listed spectrum for as long as such spectrum 
is not needed by the licensee.15  Google contends a “use it or share it” approach provides more of 
an incentive for large carriers to enter into usage agreements with small, rural carriers than “use 
it or lose it” rules because “if a licensee does not see an economic reason to build out a portion of

 its license area, … the threat of losing that portion … would have little impact on that licensee’s 
behavior.”16  While Google’s assessment of “use it or lose it” rules creating little incentive for 
large carriers to sell or lease portions of their spectrum to small, rural providers may be accurate, 
such rules would still prevent large carriers from warehousing the spectrum while also making 
such spectrum available to small, rural carriers who would use the spectrum to provide valuable 
services to their communities.  Furthermore, as WISPA noted, “use it or share it” rules provide 
“only a basis for interim unlicensed use rather than a more reliable, exclusive licensed use for a 
definitive period.”17   
Rural communities need and deserve reliable service that they can depend on indefinitely 
– not temporarily so that the licensee will gain the benefit of reduced regulatory fees or 
additional time to build out large markets.18  Accordingly, NTCA continues to encourage the 
Commission to adopt “use it or lose it” rules when spectrum is licensed according to large 
geographic areas to large carriers.  This is necessary to ensure rural communities do not risk 
losing leased service and providers know they can safely invest in equipment necessary to 
construct and operate the service – an expense few would take on if they risk having to “return” 
the spectrum in a few years or less.  To ensure such rules would not end up harming the very 
entities and consumers they were intended to help, i.e., the unserved and underserved rural 
communities, NTCA recommends further that any carriers who received a rural service provider

 bidding credit when awarded their license be exempt from a “use it or lose it” condition on their 
license.   
III. CONCLUSION 
As Congress recognized in establishing the Act, while the Commission has undertaken 
steps to make it easier for large carriers to sell or lease portions of their spectrum to other 
entities, more needs to be done to incentivize these carriers to sell spectrum to small, rural 
carriers.  The Commission also needs to ensure small, rural carriers have a meaningful 
opportunity to acquire spectrum on a primary basis through spectrum auctions, as providers – 
and customers who rely on them – cannot build a business on secondary spectrum alone. 
Consequently, NTCA recommends the Commission consider the recommendations raised in this 
proceeding and adopt rules that would place more spectrum in the hands of small, rural carriers, 
many of whom have already demonstrated their commitment to providing robust, reliable 
services to their communities.

COMMENTS OF 
NTCA–THE RURAL BROADBAND ASSOCIATION 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
NTCA–The Rural Broadband Association (“NTCA”)1 hereby submits these Comments in 
response to the request by the Federal Communications Commission (the “Commission”) for 
comment on potential changes to the Commission’s partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing 
rules to increase spectrum access by small and rural carriers, as required by the MOBILE NOW 
Act (“Act”).2 Specifically, the Commission seeks comment on (1) whether reducing performance 
requirements for spectrum obtained pursuant to the Act would facilitate deployment of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas; (2) whether the Commission should extend

 construction deadlines for carriers who purchase or lease spectrum pursuant to the Act; and (3) 
what incentives are needed to motivate licensees to lease or sell spectrum.3    
Fostering more effective use of spectrum in less densely populated rural areas that are all 
too often neglected when investment plans are developed by operators serving more urban 
markets as well is important.  Unlike large providers, smaller carriers have demonstrated their 
commitment to providing reliable telecommunications services in rural areas and are eager to 
expand the reach of their services to more areas.  NTCA therefore appreciates the Commission’s 
efforts to develop rules that will create additional opportunities for small, rural carriers to gain 
access to spectrum on a secondary basis – although these rules should not be viewed as a 
substitute for continuing to develop meaningful rules that will allow small, rural carriers to gain 
access to spectrum on a primary basis.  NTCA further encourages the Commission to develop 
rules that prohibit large carriers from warehousing spectrum or from simply selling unused 
spectrum that covers rural areas to other large carriers when seeking Commission approval to 
acquire additional licenses.    
II. TO FACILITIATE THE COMMISSION’S GOAL OF ENSURING ALL 
AMERICANS HAVE ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, 
NTCA RECOMMENDS ESTABLISHING CONSTRUCTION BENCHMARKS 
FOR ALL LICENSEES  
 
To promote more effective use of spectrum in rural areas, NTCA recommends the 
Commission adopt construction benchmarks with penalties for missing them for licenses 
covering geographic areas that are the size of partial economic areas (“PEAs”) or larger and a 
“use it or lose it” requirement for licenses issued ten or more years ago that do not include 
construction benchmarks.  For both types of licenses, the construction benchmarks or “use it or

 lose it” requirement could be met by partitioning or disaggregating portions of the licensed 
spectrum to small, rural carriers.  
Establishing construction benchmarks – that include “use it or lose it” as a penalty for 
noncompliance – is not new to the Commission.  The Commission adopted very specific 
construction benchmarks for 700 MHz licensees, which contain both interim and final 
construction requirements.  In adopting these requirements, the Commission stressed the goal of 
ensuring “scare spectrum resources are put to use and deployed in a manner that services all 
communities … regardless of where they live.”4  NTCA recommends adopting construction 
benchmarks for large geographic area licensees that mirror those applicable to 700 MHz 
licensees, including an accelerated license term for any licensee that fails to meet the interim 
construction benchmark and an automatic return to the Commission of any areas within the 
license that do not meet the final construction benchmark.  Any penalties could be avoided if a 
licensee enters a partitioning agreement with a small wireless provider, or providers, for a 
portion or portions of the service territory that would enable the original licensee to meet the 
benchmark for the remaining geographic area.  The partitionee would then obtain additional time 
to meet any construction deadlines.    At the end of the license term, any geographic areas that 
were not constructed and therefore reverted back to the Commission would be relicensed by the 
Commission to carriers dedicated to building them out and providing service to the communities 
they cover. 5

 Similar “use it or lose it” rules for existing licensees would commence at the start of the 
next license term for any licenses that were issued ten or more years ago and that do not already 
include construction benchmarks.  These rules would provide for any areas that remain 
unconstructed after a reasonable period during the next license term to be automatically returned 
to the Commission for relicensing.  Both construction benchmarks and “use it or lose it” rules 
would ensure that rural areas are not left without service due to licensees opting not to build out 
service in harder to reach areas.    
The experience of identifying actual coverage in the context of Mobility Fund Phase II 
also underscores the importance of careful Commission review of compliance with construction 
benchmarks and determinations of actual coverage area.6   The goal of making the most efficient 
use of spectrum possible in rural areas – and in determining what might be appropriate for 
partitioning or disaggregation – can only be achieved if the Commission has properly identified 
actual use of that spectrum in the first instance. 
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD NOT ADOPT RULES THAT WOULD RESULT 
 IN REDUCED SPEED OR QUALITY FOR PARTITIONED AND 
 DISAGGREGATED LICENSES.  
 
 The Commission seeks comment in the Notice regarding the potential costs of modified 
performance requirements on the speed and quality of deployment for licenses partitioned or 
disaggregated pursuant to this rulemaking proceeding.7 While NTCA agrees with the 
Commission’s suggestion that carriers acquiring disaggregated or partitioned spectrum should 
receive additional time to meet construction benchmarks, in no way should the Commission

 relax the rules governing service speed and quality. Residents and businesses across rural 
America need and deserve reliable advanced telecommunications service – not service that is 
“good enough” or “better than nothing.”8  Consequently, the Commission should ensure that any 
incentives established through the instant rulemaking proceeding do not in any way reduce the 
quality or dependability of service required for either the original licensee or the entity(ies) that 
acquire partitioned and disaggregated licenses.   
IV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD NOT TREAT SECONDARY ACCESS TO 
SPECTRUM AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PRIMARY ACCESS.   
 
While NTCA supports rules that encourage large providers to partition or disaggregate 
unused portions of their spectrum to small, rural carriers, access to spectrum on a secondary 
basis should not be treated as a substitute for access to spectrum on a primary basis.  The current 
“digital divide” clearly demonstrates that relying largely on secondary markets to fill the many 
gaps in rural telecommunications coverage will continue to leave many rural communities 
unserved.   
As described in the Notice, the Commission has permitted licensees to partition and 
disaggregate their spectrum since 1996.9  The Commission has even streamlined the application 
approval process to make many of these transactions faster and simpler.10  However, as 
Commissioner O’Rielly noted, these rules have not led to unused spectrum in rural areas being 
                                                 
8 See, e.g., 2018 Broadband Deployment Report , 33 FCC Rcd 1660, 1665 at ¶ 15 (2018) 
(identifying 25/3 Mbps as the Commission’s current speed benchmark for a service to be 
considered to have “advanced telecommunications capability”).

 placed in the hands of small providers, leaving many rural areas unserved.11  To the contrary, 
larger wireless providers routinely warehouse unused spectrum and use it as a bargaining tool 
when the Commission requires the provider to reduce their license holdings as a condition to 
acquiring another licensee.  To obtain Commission approval of the desired transaction, rather 
than sell the unused portions of their spectrum to small providers, the provider instead sells the 
spectrum to another large wireless provider, once again losing the opportunity for rural 
communities to be served by the licenses.12  As a result, large providers continue to acquire more 
spectrum while rural areas continue to remain unserved.  Congress recognized this problem and 
directed the Commission to initiate the instant rulemaking to determine what additional 
incentives could be implemented to motivate large carriers to assign unused portions of their 
spectrum to small, rural carriers.  
To ensure spectrum is placed in the hands of those who will use it, and rural communities 
will receive the services they need, the Commission must ensure small providers have a 
meaningful opportunity to participate in, and acquire spectrum through, future auctions.  Section 
309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. (“the Act”) compels the Commission to 
adopt safeguards to protect the public interest in the use of the spectrum and to promote the 
purposes of the Act – which include making radio communication service available “to all the 
people of the United States.”13  Section 309(j) further articulates certain objectives, including:

services for the benefit of the public including those residing in rural areas,  
without administrative or judicial delays; and 
 
(B) promoting economic opportunity and competition and ensuring that new and 
innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding 
excessive concentration of licenses  and by disseminating licenses among a wide 
variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies….14 
 
In Section 309(j)(4) of the Act, Congress further mandated that the Commission: 
 
(B) include performance requirements such as appropriate deadlines and penalties 
for performance failures, to ensure prompt delivery of service to rural areas, to 
prevent stockpiling or warehousing of spectrum by licensees or permittees , and to 
promote investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and services; 
[and] 
 
(C) consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the purposes of 
this Act, and the characteristics of the proposed service, prescribe area 
designations and bandwidth assignments that promote (i) an equitable 
distribution of licenses and services among geographic areas, (ii) economic 
opportunity for a wide variety of applicants, including small business, rural 
telephone companies , and businesses owned by members of minority groups and 
women,  and (iii) investment in and rapid deployment of new technologies and 
services.15 
  
Rules providing for small, rural carriers to gain access to spectrum on a primary basis are 
necessary as a practical matter as well because there is no guarantee large carriers will choose to 
partition or disaggregate unused portions of their spectrum to small, rural carriers even with 
incentives such as those proposed in the Notice.16  Consequently, the Commission must take

 Section 309(j)’s directive into account not only when considering rules that would encourage 
large carriers to enter into agreements with small, rural carriers to partition or disaggregate 
existing spectrum, but also when establishing rules governing the makeup of auctions for new 
licenses.  
NTCA’s members have a long history of providing quality advanced telecommunications 
services to their communities17 and are eager to acquire additional spectrum in order to enhance 
their existing services or expand the areas that can be reached by these services.  Developing 
rules that encourage large providers to partition or disaggregate their spectrum through 
agreements with small, rural carriers can help ensure rural communities receive the 
telecommunications services that are so necessary for residents and businesses to thrive.  
However, the Commission should also ensure that future spectrum offerings are auctioned in a 
manner that enables meaningful auction participation by small, rural carriers and the availability 
of essential telecommunications service to more homes and businesses throughout rural America.  
Both of these methods for ensuring small, rural carriers have access to spectrum are necessary to 
achieve the objectives established in Section 309(j).   
V. CONCLUSION 
NTCA supports the Commission’s goal of ensuring small, rural carriers have access to 
spectrum and such spectrum is used to provide service in rural as well as urban areas throughout

 the country.  Establishing construction benchmarks for all licensees that do not allow for 
spectrum to be warehoused and ensuring auction rules allow for meaningful participation by 
small, rural carriers are both necessary to ensure spectrum licensees provide service in small, 
rural areas.  Consequently, NTCA recommends the Commission adopt rules that establish 
construction benchmarks for all licensees, including incentives to partition and disaggregate 
portions of the licenses to small, rural carriers as well as auction rules that will allow for 
meaningful participation by small, rural carriers.

Dear Ms. Dortch:
On June 24, 2020, representatives of the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) Coalition
met by telephone with the Wireless Tel ecommunications Bureau staff listed below to discuss the 
attached IIoT proposal to incentivize voluntary secondary spectrum market transactions between 
licensees and non -government, industrial entities that have been identified in Presidential Policy 
Direc tive 21 (PPD -21) as providing critical services to the nation.  The following IIoT Coalition 
representatives participated in the call:
Kasey Chow –Southern Communications Services, Inc. d/b/a Southern Linc
Kyle Entz –Enterprise Wireless Alliance
Aryeh F ishman –Edison Electric Institute
Lance Johnson –Anterix, Inc.
Brett Kilbourne –Utilities Technology Council
Frank Korinek –Motorola Solutions, Inc.
Brian O’Hara –National Rural Electric Cooperative Association
Matt Pekarske –GE Healthcare 
David Rines –counsel to Southern Communications Services, Inc. d/b/a Southern Linc
Elizabeth Sachs –counsel to Anterix, Inc. and Enterprise Wireless Alliance
The IIoT Coalition is a group of industrial entities that rely on wireless communications 
to conduct their operations efficiently and safely, and also includes manufacturers and 
organizations that represent such entities.  Additional members include the American Petroleum 
Institute, FedEx Corp and Union Pacific Railroad Co. Collectively, these parties are the heart of 
the American economy with an increasing reliance on digital operations and IIoT applications .",0,"IIoT Coalition Notice of Ex Parte Meeting, WT 19-38 (6-26-20).pdf",the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”),"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

During the call, the IIoT representatives described the difficulties critical industries 
experience in acquiring much -needed spectrum, in particular broadband spectrum, both in the 
auction process and in the aftermarket.  Their spectrum needs are defined by industrial 
operational requirements that do not necessarily conform to FCC population or geographic 
criteria designe d to ensure optimal wireless coverage for consumer use.  The proposal would 
create a critical industrial “safe harbor” for satisfying FCC geographic license build -out 
requirements for entities in defined categories that are deploying spectrum for private, internal 
communications purposes.   
Pursuant to Section 1.1206 of the Commi ssion’s Rules, this letter is being filed 
electronically via the Electronic Comment Filing System in the above -referenced proceeding s.

Spectrum Partitioning, Disaggregation and Leasing 
1.The FCC should apply the rules adopted in this proceeding to classes of licensees 
beyond those required by the MOBILE NOW Act. 
Specificall y, the FCC should extend these rules to industrial and critical infrastructure entities 
(e.g., IIoT Coalition members) that will use the s pectrum to deplo y private wireless networks.
The objective of the MOBILE NOW Act is to promote more intensive use of spectrum in areas 
for which a licensee has no foreseeabl y anticipated demand.  This objective should apply  
equally  to facilitating its use by the nation’s industrial entities, the engine that drives the 
American econom y.
Including private industrial businesses as a category  to which these rule or policy  changes appl y 
accelerates “spectrum productivity ” and delivers the benefits of advanced II oT applications in 
industrial sectors and ultimately  to the American public.  
2.Industrial and critical infrastructure entities require licensed wireless spectrum for 
private wireless networks. Expanding the proposed rule changes to include industrial 
and critical infrastructure entities can facilitate their ability to deploy cost -effective 
private wireless networks and IIoT applications that enhance productivity, security and 
safety.
The accompan ying document, “Expanding spectrum partitioning, disaggregat ion and leasing 
rule changes to include industrial and critical infrastructure entities,” provides an overview of 
industrial entities’ need for private wireless networks using licensed spectrum, the challenges 
they have faced in acquiring spectrum through partitioning/disaggregation or securing spectrum 
leases, and the innovative IIoT applications that could be enabled through access to licensed 
spectrum.
3.The IIoT Coalition supports incentives for market -driven transactions that could 
promote greater use o f licensed spectrum via leasing/partitioning/disaggregation.
The IIoT Coalition’s specific recommendations include:
Allow build -out extensions of up to two y earsif the lease or sale agreement is reached within 
12 months of the licensee’s build -out deadline .
Adopt flexible performance requirements for internal, private wireless networks whose 
coverage and operating requirements are defined by the facilities they  cover -consistent with 
the FCC’s definition of substantial service .
Offer longer license terms for geographic authorizations to more closely  align license terms 
with lease timelines needed to provide industrial operators with investment certaint y.
Permit reaggregation of partitioned/disaggregated s pectrum.
Facilitate prompt processing of spectrum leasing transactions with minimal administrative 
effort b y the parties to implement more timely processing.",2,"IIoT Coalition Notice of Ex Parte Meeting, WT 19-38 (WTB).pdf",the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”),"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

Spectrum Partitioning, Disaggregation and Leasing 
1.The FCC should apply the rules adopted in this proceeding to classes of licensees 
beyond those required by the MOBILE NOW Act. 
Specificall y, the FCC should extend these rules to industrial and critical infrastructure entities 
(e.g., IIoT Coalition members) that will use the s pectrum to deplo y private wireless networks.
The objective of the MOBILE NOW Act is to promote more intensive use of spectrum in areas 
for which a licensee has no foreseeabl y anticipated demand.  This objective should apply  
equally  to facilitating its use by the nation’s industrial entities, the engine that drives the 
American econom y.
Including private industrial businesses as a category  to which these rule or policy  changes appl y 
accelerates “spectrum productivity ” and delivers the benefits of advanced II oT applications in 
industrial sectors and ultimately  to the American public.  
2.Industrial and critical infrastructure entities require licensed wireless spectrum for 
private wireless networks. Expanding the proposed rule changes to include industrial 
and critical infrastructure entities can facilitate their ability to deploy cost -effective 
private wireless networks and IIoT applications that enhance productivity, security and 
safety.
The accompan ying document, “Expanding spectrum partitioning, disaggregat ion and leasing 
rule changes to include industrial and critical infrastructure entities,” provides an overview of 
industrial entities’ need for private wireless networks using licensed spectrum, the challenges 
they have faced in acquiring spectrum through partitioning/disaggregation or securing spectrum 
leases, and the innovative IIoT applications that could be enabled through access to licensed 
spectrum.
3.The IIoT Coalition supports incentives for market -driven transactions that could 
promote greater use o f licensed spectrum via leasing/partitioning/disaggregation.
The IIoT Coalition’s specific recommendations include:
Allow build -out extensions of up to two y earsif the lease or sale agreement is reached within 
12 months of the licensee’s build -out deadline .
Adopt flexible performance requirements for internal, private wireless networks whose 
coverage and operating requirements are defined by the facilities they  cover -consistent with 
the FCC’s definition of substantial service .
Offer longer license terms for geographic authorizations to more closely  align license terms 
with lease timelines needed to provide industrial operators with investment certaint y.
Permit reaggregation of partitioned/disaggregated s pectrum.
Facilitate prompt processing of spectrum leasing transactions with minimal administrative 
effort b y the parties to implement more timely processing.",2,"IIoT Coalition Notice of Ex Parte Meetings, WT 19-38 (12-5-19).pdf",the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”),"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 Re: WT Docket No. 19- 38 
  Ex Parte  Presentation  
 Dear Ms. Dortch:  
  The Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) Coalition files this Ex Parte  communication in 
support of the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC” or “Commission”) initiation of the instant proceeding
1 in response to the Mobile Now Act.2  The II oT Coalition is a group of industrial 
entities that rely on wireless communications to conduct their operations efficiently and safely or are organizations that represent such entities.  They include electric and gas utilities whose services are fundamental to the day- to-day activities of all Americans, as well as entities that operate 
components of the transportation nervous system through which American commerce runs such as pipelines, trucking, freight rail, airports, overnight delivery services, and por ts.  Manufacturers 
of virtually all products produced in this country are represented, as are farming operations and medical facilities.  Collectively, these parties are the heart of the American economy with an increasing  reliance on IIoT applications.     
  The companies represented in the IIoT Coalition utilize a variety of wireless systems to 
meet their increasingly complex communications requirements.  Most use commercial wireless networks for certain applications, but the majority also require private wireless facilities.  In some 
instances, their industrial operations are situated in remote areas well beyond the coverage of commercial providers.  In other cases, the industrial entities must meet specific reliability, resiliency, security and/or functi onal criteria that are not satisfied on commercial networks.
3  Those 
requirements demand deployment of systems that are designed, constructed, and operated by the 
industrial entities themselves, giving them control over their facilities, including the ability to 
isolate them from the Internet and its associated secu rity issues.  
 
 Just as these companies utilize both commercial and private systems, many also use 
licensed and unlicensed spectrum.  Unlicensed spectrum has a place in their communications 
portfolios as it is useful for certain applications, but given the core responsibilities of these 
companies, the majority of which are classified as “Critical Infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security,
4 their operations cannot be conducted on unlicensed spectrum that does not

 ensure appropriate levels of secu rity and reliability.  However, it is challenging to acquire the 
licensed spectrum needed for private wireless networks on which advanced IIoT capabilities can 
be deployed, particularly wireless broadband spectrum capable of supporting the innovative 
wirel ess technologies and connectivity solutions that American industry needs to maintain its 
global preeminence.  
 
 For this reason, the IIoT Coalition welcomes the initiation of this proceeding by the 
Commission in response to the MOBILE NOW Act.  Congress has  directed the Commission to 
investigate whether it could promote more intensive utilization of licensed, geographic spectrum 
through leasing and partitioning/disaggregation rules or policies that would make unused spectrum available to unaffiliated small c arriers and carriers serving rural communities.  The IIoT Coalition 
supports this initiative, although it also emphasizes that secondary market transaction are 
supplementa l to and not a sufficient substitute for dedicated licensed spectrum.  This 
Congressi onal objective would be further enhanced by applying the rules adopted in this 
proceeding to classes of licensees beyond those required by the MOBILE NOW Act as suggested by the FCC.
5  In particular, the FCC should extend these rules to entities such as II oT Coalition 
members that will use the spectrum to deploy private wireless systems as recommended by the 
American Petroleum Institute (“API”).6    
  The Act requires the FCC to consider four questions in this rulemaking proceeding.  First, 
the Commission must determine whether reducing the performance requirements for entities that acquire spectrum through leasing/partitioning/disaggregation would facilitate deployment of advanced technologies in the covered areas.  Second, it must consider what conditions will be needed to ensure that spectrum is deployed in a reasonable period of time.  Third, the Commission is directed to consider incentives for making spectrum available through these means, including by extending license terms or modifying performance re quirements for the leased or assigned 
spectrum.  Finally, the Commission must evaluate the administrative feasibility of these or other incentives.     The Act presents these questions in the context of making spectrum available for small and 
rural carrier operations.  However, the overriding objective –  promoting the more intensive 
utilization of spectrum for which a licensee has no foreseeably anticipat ed demand  – should apply 
equally to facilitating its use by the nation’s industrial entities, the engine that is foundational to and drives the economic life of the country.  
  Attachment A describes the myriad advanced technology use cases for which IIoT  
Coalition members require broadband spectrum that could be leased or acquired under the programs that are adopted in this proceeding.  It also details the challenges they have faced in 
accessing the necessary spectrum under the current rules.  These entit ies recognize that all 
spectrum leases or sales must involve a mutually satisfactory economic component.  Licensees that have acquired spectrum from the FCC or in the secondary market must be motivated, not mandated, to enter into spectrum transactions tha t are consistent with their own economic interests 
and those of the acquiring party.  The IIoT Coalition believes that the following rule or policy changes would act as incentives for voluntary transactions that could promote greater use of leasing/partitioning/ disaggregation opportunities.

1) Allow build -out extensions of up to two years if the lease or sale agreement is 
reached within 12 months of the licensee’s build- out deadline . 
 
The Commission’s build- out requirements have a single objective:  ensur e that spectrum 
resources are placed into use within a reasonable time or are returned to the FCC until reauctioned 
or otherwise made available to a new licensee.  Commercial service providers typically do not 
need further incentives to deploy network faci lities in  areas where population density drives 
financially -based metrics to satisfactory economic returns  These metrics are challenged in areas 
lacking favorable population densities. 
 
Members of the IIoT Coalition and other industrial entities value spectrum based on a  
different metric.  They do not provide a for -profit communications service to the public, but utilize 
spectrum to address internal operating requirements such as those described in the use cases in Attachment A.   Their needs are indepen dent of population density and sometimes are in areas 
where commercial wireless network deployments are uneconomic.  Instead, the value is based on deploying and operating reliable, secure, and robust connectivity on a geographically defined basis 
to manage and monitor critical industrial infrastructure and other industrial operations responsible 
for sustaining U.S. economic activity.   
 If a commercial operator determines within 12 months of its build- out deadline that 
deployment of additional network facil ities is needed in an area where it has no incentive to build, 
allowing it to lease or assign to a private enterprise entity in conjunction with a deadline extension would be a sound public policy outcome.  It would provide an incentive for a transaction t hat 
would put spectrum into highly productive use in an otherwise undeployed area in a reasonable amount of time.  The alternative, having the FCC recover the spectrum , promotes inefficiency .  It  
too frequently results in spectrum remaining in the Commiss ion’s inventory for very extended 
periods while waiting in queue behind other auctions or alternative means of reassigning recovered 
spectrum.       
 
2) Adopt flexible performance requirements for private internal systems whose 
coverage and operating requi rements are defined by the parameters of the 
facilities they need to cover ( e.g., factories, refineries, airports, pipelines, and 
ports), building on the FCC’s description of  “substantial service” as one that 
addresses a unique, niche market . 
 
Attachment A describes the challenges faced by industrial users when trying to acquire 
spectrum in the auction process.  Their coverage requirements rarely conform to the relatively 
large licensing areas sold in auctions.  Even counties, the smallest geogr aphic component used by 
the FCC, often encompass more geography than needed for private wireless users.  It is not economically practical for these licensees to compete in the auction process against entities whose business models are based on providing se rvice to as great a percentage of population as possible 
within a wide geographic area, a model that mirrors the FCC’s build- out criteria.   Conversely,",2,IIoT Ex Parte WT 19-38  11-7-19.pdf,the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”),"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"4 
 industrial users’ wireless coverage and service objectives are typically operation area- specific, 
defined  by the need to manage and monitor industrial infrastructure and field- based assets.   
 
This same issue arises in the secondary market when an industrial entity seeks to purchase 
spectrum from a successful auction participant.  Whether the industrial user must independently meet the build -out requirement for the geographic area it wishes to a cquire, or the carrier intends 
to rely on that entity’s deployment to help satisfy the build- out requirement for the entire auction 
area, performance criteria tailored to private industrial users’ internal requirements will provide an incentive for these v oluntary transactions.  The result will be deployment of advanced 
technologies on spectrum that otherwise might remain unused for an extended period, either by 
the carrier or by being held in Commission inventory.  The FCC can promote that outcome by  
adopting provisions that recognize deployment of advanced technology by an industrial user as delivering a vital, substantial, niche service to the public, a service different but not lesser than the service provided on a commercial network.   
 The Commission has already acknowledged that utilities, one category of industrial user, 
may use wireless broadband spectrum for a variety of internal applications that do not always fit neatly into the FCC’s delineations of system types for build- out purposes.  In grant ing waiver 
relief,  the Commission took into account that the utilities targeted as potential lessees of the 2.3 GHz WCS C and D Block spectrum held by AT&T, “might not fall within the traditional mobile, point -to-multipoint, or point -to-point fixed models .”
7  It recognized that:  
hybrid or non -traditional operations that do not fit precisely into one category; for 
example, there may be WCS point -to-multipoint systems that could be viewed as 
functionally consistent with a WCS point -to-point RF network, e.g., certain smart 
grid links to monitoring stations, maintenance instrumentation, automatic metering, 
collection points, and video surveillance.8 
 
The FCC concluded that “in order to ensure a satisfactory level of construction for each of its 
markets while ac commodating AT&T’s anticipated deployment, we will require AT&T to meet 
its population coverage obligation by establishing a significant presence in a minimum number of states within each REAG.”
9   
A similarly flexible approach would allow industrial entities to demonstrate that they are 
making productive use of spectrum through measurements other than the population or geography covered by their facilities.  Spectrum utilization could, and should, be evaluated based on the investment they make in their deployment and the resulting benefits, including advanced IIoT applications that they implement as a result of that investment, and the benefits thereby delivered to their customers, which typically are a significant segment of the American public.

 3) Conti nue the trend toward longer license terms for geographic authorizations to 
more closely align license terms with lease timelines needed to support 
investments by industrial users . 
 
The economic model of commercial networks is based on payments received from  
subscribers as rapidly as possible.  By contrast, investments by industrial entities in spectrum and 
the facilities deployed on them are expected to be recouped over time through factors such as 
increased productivity, operating efficiencies, and intangibles such as superior security protection and reliability.  These are long -term business objectives that require long- term investment 
strategies.  Industrial entities typically cannot justify investing in a spectrum lease of limited 
duration, particularly s ince neither the licensee nor the FCC is able to guarantee that the underlying 
license will be renewed so that the lease may be extended.  For example, utility assets typically 
are depreciated over 20 - or 30- year periods, sometime s even longer.      
For thi s reason, the IIoT Coalition supports the Commission’s recent consideration of 15-
year or even longer license terms.
10  It is significantly more likely that an industrial user will be 
able to justify a lease of this length rather than the 10- year or shorter  leases available today.  This 
better correlation between a lessee’s investment model and the FCC’s license terms will lead to 
greater interest in spectrum leasing options. 
 
4) Process leases under IAP and make other changes to the FCC forms to facilitate 
prompt processing with minimal administrative effort by the parties . 
 
The IIoT Coalition agrees with commenters that recommend processing leases and 
subleases under the Commission’s Immediate Approval Procedures (“IAP”).11  Streamlining the 
approval process  should provide an incentive to parties that might otherwise be deterred by a 
review period that can be lengthy and whose length cannot be determined in advance.  Of course, 
the processing time necessarily is dependent o n the number of lease applications filed and 
limitations on staff resources, but the uncertainty of the timing discourages greater use of the 
leasing option.  IAP processing would resolve that issue.  Since the Commission always retains 
the right to set as ide the actions it takes within 30 days,12 there is little if any risk that relying on 
IAP will result in lease approvals that are determined to be contrary to the public interest.  
The changes proposed to the Form 608 itself by various parties would also be welcome, 
but such changes typically involve substantial time and investment by the FCC.  Even the simplest 
modification of an FCC form can take what in the private sector might be considered an inordinate 
amount of time.  Therefore, while the IIoT Coal ition endorses those proposals, it urges the FCC to 
act on those matters that can be implemented by Commission action without involving third -party 
vendors.

 5) Permit reaggregation of partitioned/disaggregated spectrum . 
 
A number of carriers strongly supported allowing them to reaggregate spectrum that has 
been partitioned and/or disaggregated.13  The IIoT Coalition agrees that this is a common- sense 
option that should be implemented promptly.  It is administratively burdensome both for the FCC 
and licensees to administer multiple call signs that collectively constituted a single original license.  
The alarms raised by some about this option being misused to “game” the system and allow 
licensees to evade build -out requirements appear to the IIoT Coalition to be over -blown and well 
within the Commission’s ability to manage.   
 
6) Reinstitute the spectrum dashboard so parties can identify available spectrum . 
 Many members of the IIoT Coalition used the Commission’s spectrum dashboard in the 
past and would welcome its reconstitution and availability for public access.  As more bands are made available and as this proceeding achieves its goal of promoting leasing, partitioning and disaggregation, identifying available spectrum will become an increasingly diff icult task.  
Reviving the spectrum dashboard or a similar tool and updating it routinely for public use would further the objectives of the MOBILE NOW Act.  
  
Conclusion  
The existing leasing, partitioning, and disaggregation rules are important tools in 
promoting the more efficient use of spectrum but, as noted in the Act, more could be done. The 
use of these market -based transactions will be enhanced by adoption of the incentives and process 
improvements proposed in the NPRM and supported herein.  Including private industrial entities 
as a category to which these rule or policy changes apply will act as an accelerant in placing spectrum into productive use and delivering the benefits of advanced IIoT applications to the American public.

 The Potential for the IIoT via Licensed Spectrum Access and Private Wireless Networks  
 
The IIoT is delivering significant gains in industrial operations and services. Efficiency, 
productivity, security, safety and performance in industrial sectors such as electric power, oil and 
gas, manufacturing, healthcare, freight rail, and transportation will reap benefits from the IIoT. The IIoT has the potential to boost U.S. industrial sectors’ economic performance. For example, 
Accenture
1 estimates that IIoT can add US $6.1 trillion to the United States’ economy by 2030 
and by improving the nation’s broadband networks infrastructure, which would include broadband wireless access, this figure could grow to US $7.1 trillion.   Enabling the IIoT with dedicated, secure private wireless networks is critical to delivering on the operational benefits and eco nomic performance for U.S. industrial sectors. Industrial companies 
are looking to work with technology vendors to develop new IIoT connectivity solutions that take advantage of private 4G and soon 5G networks for automating, monitoring, and managing indus trial infrastructure and field assets. Access to licensed spectrum is a critical enabler for 
taking advantage of innovations in real-time access to digital industrial data and edge computing technologies.  Industrial operations increasingly use digital inspection and sensor technologies such as aerial drones, robots and high-resolution video cameras. Leveraging these automated inspection capabilities provides industrial and critical infrastructure operators with access to real -time 
monitoring and inspection data from oil refineries and wells, gas pipelines, electrical grids and substations, gas compression facilities and remote facilities that are not easily or safely accessible by human inspectors and technicians. Drones, robots, video cameras and other connected devices can perform inspections and provide access to industrial machinery and data 
in remote areas in a real -time, secure and safe manner.   
 New developments and innovation in edge computing technology will enable industrial operators to process and store vast amounts of data that is generated by industrial and critical infrastructure machinery, sensors and other remote monitoring equipment. Using edge computing technology allows industrial and critical infrastructure operators to process and analyze real -time data to 
boost productivity and operational efficiency, proactively reduce operations downtime, improve fault avoidance and promote safety. 
Industrial and critical infrastructure operators have struggled to gain access to licensed spectrum 
in a cost -effective or site-specific manner.  Past and upcoming spectrum auctions entailed or will 
entail large licensing areas, e.g., Counties, Partial Economic Areas (PEAs). With larger licensing areas, spectrum auctions have raised more than US $20 billion based on the last three FCC auctions including the Incentive Auction, Auction 102 and 102, and are tailored to meet the needs of commercial wireless carriers with spending capacity. For their site -specific private

 wireless networks, industrial and critical  infrastructure operators cannot realistically bid on an 
entire county or PEA, let alone compete with the traditional carriers on spectrum acquisition.   Access to licensed spectrum is a critical enabler for taking advantage of innovations in real -time 
access to digital industrial data and edge computing technologies.  Gaining affordable and timely 
access to licensed spectrum is critical for industrial operators to be able to deploy and operate private 4G and 5G networks to take advantage of the development s in remote inspection and 
access, and edge computing technologies and solutions. Private wireless networks using licensed spectrum enable industrial and critical infrastructure operators with interference -free, low -
latency, high- bandwidth, controllable wi reless connectivity for their mission -critical operations.  
Industrial and critical infrastructure operators cannot solely rely upon traditional wireless operator networks to deliver the secure, wireless network functionality needed for their mission-critical operations. While industrial users have access to wireless spectrum in frequency bands such as 450 MHz, 600 MHz, 900 MHz, 1.4 GHz, 6 GHz and 38 GHz, they lack sufficient bandwidth and allow only limited scalability to support the growing base of indust rial connected 
assets and IIoT digital applications. Additionally, many industrial and critical infrastructure sites are located in remote areas with inadequate indoor and outdoor wireless coverage.  
 Alternatively, industrial operators can secure licensed spectrum through spectrum leasing via secondary market transactions with larger licensees, which are typically the traditional wireless carriers. Though spectrum leasing transactions occur, secondary market transactions have to date had a limited impact on  enabling small and innovative spectrum users with acceptable and 
affordable conditions to acquire spectrum. Rather, secondary market spectrum leasing 
transactions have successfully enabled traditional wireless carriers to expand or consolidate their spect rum holdings.  
 Industrial operators have faced several challenges in executing efficient and affordable spectrum leases with larger licensees for their private wireless networks and these include:  
 
•
         Unaffordability . Electric utilities looking to connect an exponentially growing base of 
mission -critical, wirelessly connected field assets and infrastructure are unable to close 
deals with wireless carriers to affordably lease 20 to 40 MHz of licensed spectrum. High transaction costs, network buildout  and service area obligations contribute to the 
unaffordability, which results in unused spectrum not being put to good economic and productive use.  
 
•
         Lack of Investment Certainty . Hospitals and electric utilities seek investment certainty 
for the ir private network deployments. Having a spectrum lease for up to 15 years 
capitalizes on investment certainty.  
 
•         Limited Financial Incentives for Leasing.  Without making market -based or financial 
incentives available (e.g., such as bidding credit s for future spectrum auctions), larger 
licensees , such as wireless carriers are not motivated to devote corporate resources to 
making their excess spectrum or undeployed licensed areas available for leases to private wireless network operators.",7,IIoT Ex Parte WT 19-38  11-7-19.pdf,the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”),"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"ATTACHMENT A

   Industrial and critical infrastructure operators’ lack of efficient and affordable access to licensed spectrum through auctions or secondary markets has negatively impacted operations in many areas. Described below are three examples of how the lack of acc ess to licensed spectrum via 
secondary markets is causing an impact in three industrial sectors, namely freight rail operations, energy utilities and hospitals:  
 
•
         Freight Railway. Lack of innovation in operations precision, automation and security at 
major rail yards.  The lack of licensed spectrum limits real- time asset tracking, engine 
train performance data analysis, integration of cyber security in data transmission, and use of technologies to remotely monitor rail operations to better ensure s afety and 
derailment.  
 
•
         Energy Utilities . Without access to licensed spectrum with greater amounts of 
bandwidth, utilities must rely on Wi -Fi, spectrum with lower channel bandwidths or the 
carriers’ public wireless networks. These options do not consistently provide interference protections, 24x7x365 availability and reliability, scalability and quality of service. The lack of higher bandwidth licensed spectrum limits opportunities for utilities.  It delays their ability to deploy new IIoT devices  and networks to improve the safety, security and 
productivity of utility distribution networks.  
•
         Hospitals . Medical care facilities typically use WiFi and WMTS (Wireless Medical 
Telemetry Service) for private network data connectivity. The inability to affordably lease and deploy licensed spectrum limits hospitals from integrating new IIoT devices and applications with private 4G and 5G networks to deliver quality patient care and services including: real -time patient and v ital signs monitoring, robust low -latency 
connectivity for triggering drug administration, and enabling greater clinical equipment mobility to provide timely care for mobile and remote patients.  
 It is imperative that any rule changes to facilitate secondary market transactions for spectrum partitioning, disaggregation and leasing apply to common carriers and non- carriers, including 
industrial and critical infrastructure operators.  This provision not only creates a viable roadmap for industrial and critica l infrastructure operators to more affordably procure and deploy site -

REPLY C OMMENTS OF SPRINT CORPORATION  
 
Sprint  Corporation (“Sprint”) hereby replies to comments on the Federal Communications 
Commission’s (“Commission’s”) above -captioned Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on its rules 
and policies for the partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing of spectrum licenses.1  Sprint agrees 
with commenters who urge  the Commission to permit wireless licensees to reaggregate 
previously partitioned or disaggregated licenses , given the p ublic interest benefits of re -forming 
originally auctioned licenses.  The Commission should establish a specific, efficient licensing 
procedure for such spectrum reaggregation.  In addition,  Sprint supports CTIA’s call to eliminate 
unnecessary  procedural obstacles to spectrum leasing  and to streamlin e the approval process for 
block -to-block spectru m swaps . 
I. THE COMMIS SION SHOULD ENABLE PA RTIES TO REA GGREGATE  
ORIGINALLY AUCTIONED WIRELESS LICENSES  EFFICIENTLY  
 
The Commission in the NPRM  recognizes that, under its current rules, there  is no specific 
provision for reaggregat ing previously subdivided com ponents of a geogra phic area license , even 
when the partitioned or disaggregated portions of an original license are held by a single entity.2  
The Commission seeks comment on whether it should formally permit such license re -

 consolidation.  A num ber of co mmenters support th is step, pointing to potential benefits for 
licensees, the Commission, and wireless consumers.3  Sprint has long favored Commission 
creation  of a spectrum reaggregation mechanism ,4 and it reiterates this supp ort below.    
A. The Co mmission Should Establish a  Specific Mechanism for Spectrum 
Reaggregation  and License Re -Consolidation  
 
Sprint agrees with CTIA  that the Commission should establish  a streamlined, efficient 
licensing procedure enabling the reaggregation  of previously parti tioned or  disaggregated 
spectrum to re -form  origi nally auctioned wireless licenses.5  Sprint and other opera tors have 
pursued such reaggregation on an ad hoc  basis through existing licensing procedures,  but these  
processes have been in consistent and often  involved  lengthy review by Commission staff .6

6  In January 2018 , Sprint used existing pro forma  assignment process es to attempt to 
reaggregate partitioned spectrum  and re -consol idate an orig inal lic ense.  See Nextel 
Communicatio ns of the Mid -Atlantic, Inc., De scription of Pro F orma  Assignment and Public 
Interest Statemen t, ULS File No. 0008063765, at 1 (filed Jan. 16, 2018) (explaining tha t the 
purpose of the assignment is to allow a wholly  owned subs idiary of Spr int Corp oration “to 
reconsolidate the small part itioned spectrum a rea licensed under WPQT200 with the underlyi ng 
license WPLM552 – from which i t originally came”).  While the Commi ssion granted the initial 
step in the application process – the movement of the lice nses to the same licensing ent ity – the 
Commission has yet  to process the application to re aggregate t he spectrum into one license.  
Sprint’s research shows that the Comm ission has previously processed ad hoc  applications to re -
consol idate licenses across  a host of wireless spectrum bands.  See Nextel WIP License  Corp.,

 In place of today’s ad hoc  proce sses, the Commission should create  a uniform 
mechanism  that allows  licensees to  notify the  Commission staff that they wish to reaggrega te 
previously partitioned or disaggregated  spectrum and re -consti tute spectrum  license s.  Parties 
would file this notice in the Commission’s Universal Licensing System (“ULS”) , triggering  the 
requested licens e modifications in that database.   Signi ficantly , an entity should be able to  
execute  this re-consolidation  wheth er or not it has prev iously held the original license s, or even if 
the re -consolidation is only for p ortion s of the original license .7   
As CTIA point s out in its comments , the Commission need not adopt a rule to effectuate 
this spectrum reaggregation mech anism .  The Commissio n has recognized that it can implement 
this mechanism  as a procedural matter, explaining that “[t]he question of whether, and how, a 
partitioned or disaggregated licens e can be reconstituted as a matter or processing can be 
addressed b y Commission staff un der current rules a nd licensing systems.”8  Pursuant to the 
instant proceeding, t he Commission should expeditiously establish  this license re-consolidation 
procedure as a filing option in ULS.  
B. A Spectrum Re aggregat ion Mechanism Will P roduce Significant Pu blic 
Interest Benefits  
 
The Commission will generate significant public interest b enefits  by adopting an efficient 
spectrum reaggregation mechanism .  As commenters point out, this lice nse re -consolidation  
                                                 
7  Licensee s should be permitted to  seek even partial re-consolidatio ns of wireless licenses 
and should not be limited to reaggregat ing only entire  license s as originally  auctioned .  Sprint 
notes  that, f or the most part, it has reacquired all component parts of  given licenses and would 
seek to re -consolid ate those full licenses.

 procedure will reduce regulato ry bu rdens and encour age secondary market activity  that benefit s 
carriers and customers throughout the United States, including in rural areas.9  
Wireless operators holding  multiple  partitioned or disaggre gated  licenses  typically  incur  
extensive administra tive and regulatory costs to comply with separate construction requirements, 
renewal  provisions, and continuous service obligations  for each license . Moreover, w here 
numerous  licenses now cover what was originally a single auctioned license area, a multipl e-
license holder is s ubject to administrative burdens far exceed ing those  faced by the ori ginal 
licensee  and, in some cases,  it must monitor, track, and update thousands of licenses . 
As commenters poi nt out, adopti ng an efficient, streamlined reaggregation  process  will 
signifi cantly decrease  administrative and regulatory costs for wireless licensees and reduce the 
administrative  burden on the Commission .10  Consolidation of previously partitioned a nd/or 
disaggregated licenses will  simplify licensees’ complia nce with applicable r equirements , as well 
as the administration, monitoring, and tracking of their licenses.  Certainly, as a nationwide 
carrier holding over 35,000  discrete spectrum licenses  across  three major wireless spectrum bands 
(800 MHz, 1.9 GHz and  2.5 GHz)  – many of which were pre viously par titioned or disaggregated  
and/or obtained t hrough secondary market  transactions  – Sprint understands and appreciates the 
operational and financial accounting benefits that would result from consolidation  of its license 
portfolio (and , in turn, streamlining of the Commi ssion’s ULS data base) .   
 Creating a reagg regation procedure in ULS ultimately  will reduce the overall number of 
ULS filings .  Once Sprint and other operators can efficiently reaggregate spectrum and re -
constitute origin ally auctioned  licens es, there will be fewer bui ld-out demonstrations, renewal

 applications, and continuity of service showings for the Commission to process .  The 
Commission  will conserve its scarce resources  by improving i ts reaggregation p rocedures .           
Perhaps counterintui vely, an efficient license re-consolidation procedure will  also 
promote  license partitioning and disaggregation and other secondary market activity .  Because 
license reaggregation today involves an  uncertain, diffic ult proces s, wireless licensee s are 
sometimes reluc tant to partition or disaggregate their authorizations , knowing that they w ill be 
subject to multiple , burdensome  requirements if they re -acquire t hat spectrum .  Sprint has chosen 
not to pursue some second ary mark et trans actions that m ay have  been  benefici al for both parties, 
given the burdens  that it would face should circumstances  change and it eventually re -acquire d 
the spectrum .  In contrast, a stream lined reaggregation procedure will reassure  licensee s that if 
and whe n they again h old the full, origina l license area, or even major portions of the original 
license area , they can reduce their regulatory and admin istrative burden s for those license s.  As R 
Street Institute states, “ Permitting  free reaggreg ation alongside disaggregation  would . . .  
incenti vize initial licensees to participate in the secondary market in the first place. ”11  By 
eliminati ng a potential d eterrent to s pectrum partitioning and disaggregation, a license re -
consolidati on mechanism  will facilitate s pectrum access  by small carriers an d promote advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas.12    
Finally, contrary to  one comme nter’s claims, an efficient spectrum  reaggregation 
procedure  will not enable licensees to avoi d or “game” their performance requirements .13

 Rather, this mechan ism will promote fairness  in licensing , since the build -out obligations for a 
re-constituted lic ense will be the same as they would have been had the license never been 
partitioned or disaggr egated .  Of co urse, if re -consolidation  of a license occurs after  the initial 
performance requirements throughout that license area are satisfied , this issue is r endered moot.14 
II. SPRINT SUPPORTS CTIA’S COMMENTS ON STREAMLINING  ISSUES  
 
Beyond  the spectrum reaggregatio n issue, Sprint gener ally favors  the other positions 
taken by CTIA in its comments.   In partic ular, Sprint supports CTIA’s call to eliminat e 
unnecessary procedural obstacles to spectrum leasing.  As CTIA suggests, the Commission 
should either mak e most spectrum  leases subject to pri or notifica tion by licensees/les sees rather 
than Commissi on approval, or ensure that its immediate approval procedures apply to all 
spectrum lease filings that meet applicable eligibility requirements.15  In addition, Sp rint agrees 
that the Commission  shoul d update FCC Form 608 to allow p arties to use that form to assign 
their leases and convert short -term leases  to long -term leases, negating the need for inefficient 
workarounds requiring multiple filings.16  The Commissio n should also p ermit spectrum 
manager  lessees to  use FCC  Form 608 to make necessary filings th at neither require lessee action 
nor affect the und erlying license (such as administrative updates and notifications of pro forma  
transfers).17  Further, as CTIA r equests, partie s should be able  to su bmit FCC Fo rm 608 sublease 
                                                 
14  As CTIA points out in  its comments,  the Commission in the 2017 WRS Order  addressed 
concerns r egarding the “gaming ” of construction obligati ons.  CTIA Comments at 15-16.  There, 
the Comm ission adopted unified build -out requirements for spectrum that is partitio ned or 
disaggrega ted, so that parties to a transac tion are either individually or jointly  held accountable 
for build -out requirements.  2017 WRS Order  ¶¶ 74 -80.  Certainly,  a formal  reaggregation 
mechanism will not undo the effects of that order.

 filings electronically rather than manually as is the case today.18  Finally, the Commission should 
streamline its approval process for block -to-block spectrum swaps within the same geographic 
footprint, given that these transacti ons do not raise competitive con cerns.19  With these actions , 
the Commission  will increase  regulatory efficiency, reduce administrative burdens, provide 
licensees and lessees with additional flexibility, and encour age secondary market activity that 
benefits  small and rural carriers and th e customers they se rve. 
III. CONCLUSION  
 
For the aforementioned reasons, Sprint urges the Commission to adopt an efficient  
licensing  mechanism that enabl es licensees to reaggregate previ ously partitioned and  
disaggregated s pectru m and re-form originally auction ed wireless license s.  The Commission  
should  also eliminate unnecessary procedural obstacles to spectrum leasing and streamline its 
approval process for block -to-block spectrum swaps .

REPLY COMMENTS OF THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION, INC.  
 
The Rural Wireless Association, Inc. (“RWA”) files the following reply  comments in 
response to comments filed in  the Federal Communications Commission ’s (“FCC” or 
“Commission”) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (“NPRM ”) in the above referenced docket .1  
RWA agrees with several commenters that many of the purported  license partitioning, 
disaggregati on, leasing, and network build -out “problems” that Congress attempted to fix 
through Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act are  in fact  symptoms of a problem inherent in   
prima ry-market FCC spectrum auctions:  namely, the FCC ’s using of geographic area license 
sizes that are too large.2  Furthermore, RWA believes that as more and more license bands get 
released for commercial use in the years and decades ahead, the Commission needs  to modernize

 its Universal Licensing System (“ULS”) , or re-launch its Spectrum Dashboard, to make  licensing 
queries more user -friendly, intu itive, and incorporate greater visual and mapping functionality.  
However, RWA disagrees with some comment ers who suggest that  the FCC should : (1) provide 
incentives to large  carriers/licensees to help them lease, partition, or disaggregate spectrum; (2); 
extend the proposed performance rules that relax build -out requirements to non -common carriers 
(e.g., incumbent service providers, cable companies, wireless Internet service providers); and (3)  
remove any and all barriers to secondary market transactions, including by streamlining the 
approval process for leases and transfers.  
I. THERE IS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT IN THE RECORD FOR  SMALLER 
LICENSE SIZES IN FUTURE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS .  
 
There is an inherent problem in the spectrum marketplace today, and it begins with 
those winning FCC auction bidders acquiring more licenses than they can build -out in a timely 
fashion, and those acquired licenses being too large  in terms of geographic size .  The simplest 
solution to fixing this problem  is having the FCC “right size” its  spectrum licenses when it 
converts spectrum to commercial use and simultaneously establishes service rules and license 
sizes .  To the extent that leased spectrum, partitioned spectrum, or disaggregated spectrum is put 
to a better use  by a secondary licens ee, this is because the spectrum was not appropriately 
licensed to the original licensee .  RWA has been a long -time proponent of having the 
Commission use Cellular Market  Areas (“ CMAs” ), or smaller, license areas , and in the case of 
high-band spectrum, usi ng licenses the size of counties. The National Rural Electric Cooperative 
Association  (“NRECA”)3  and the  America Petroleum Institute  (“API”)4  agree with this concept.

 Accordingly, in all future FCC spectrum auctions, the Commission should offer licenses  that use 
smaller geographic areas that will expedite the deployment of actual 4G and 5G services and 
reduce the need for carriers to lease, partition, or disaggregate spectrum in order to have a second 
licensee fulfil l the original build -out or performanc e requirements.       
II. THE MODERNIZATION OF THE COMMISSION’S UNIVERSAL 
LICENSING SYSTEM, OR A RE -LAUNCH OF THE COMMISSION’S 
SPECTRUM DASHBOARD, WILL DEMOCRATIZE PUBLIC ACCESS TO 
SPECTRUM HOLDINGS AND ENCOURAGE RURAL MARKET BUILD -
OUT .  
 
Several commenters no ted that the secondary spectrum markets operate inefficiently, 
and that a modernization of the information technology databases that track the various spectrum 
holdings is a significant contributor to that inefficiency.  CTIA – The Wireless Association  
(“CTIA”)  recommended that the Commission revive its dormant “Spectrum Dashboard” that was 
significantly more user -friendly than the current Universal Licensing System.5  Select Spectrum 
LLC urged the Commission to “invest money and expertise to improve th e reliability and 
functionality of ‘ULS’.”6  Even the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance, which is arguing for a new 
“dynamic [spectrum] database,” acknowledged that not only does there exist today an “inability 
for potential buyers to obtain information on availab le spectrum”7 but also that “[f]inding 
available spectrum” is “particularly  time-consuming  and costly.”8 To the extent the Commission 
improves the transparency of commercial spectrum holdings to the general public (whether via 
the ULS or the Spectrum Dashb oard or something new), the more likely investors, entrepreneurs,

 and rural carriers will seek out fallow spectrum held by current licensees or even the FCC.  RWA 
recognizes that the Commission’s budget to improve licensing databases and mapping systems is  
limited, but such improvements will promote rural wireless build -out in a more expedited basis 
and without waiting for licensees to partition, disaggregate or lease spectrum towards the end of 
their initial terms.  
 
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD STOP ENCOURAGING  LARGE CARRIERS 
AND OTHER LICENSEES WHO FAIL TO EXERCISE “PORTION 
CONTROL” WHEN BIDDING ON LICENSES  IN FCC SPECTRUM 
AUCTIONS  
 
The American Petroleum Institute, perhaps unintentionally, highlights a glaring 
problem in the wireless marketplace today.  It claims that its members have “reported that efforts 
to acquire spectrum from major telecommunication carriers have not be [sic] effective” due in 
large part to “a reluctance by the large carriers to encumber their unused spectrum based on 
competitive matte rs.”9  Nationwide carriers/licensees, because of their clout, sit on spectrum for 
long periods of time after an FCC auction and have little intention of allowing competitors to 
access this spectrum .   API’s members are obviously frustrated, and RWA’s membe rs know this 
feeling all too well.  Unfortunately, the API’s solution – namely extending various “positive ” 
incentives to large carriers and licensees - - is completely misguided.  Once again, the solution to 
reducing the amount of fallow spectrum in the U .S. is not to make it easier for large licensees 
and nationwide carrier s to sit on spectrum until the last minute and then selectively jettison small 
slivers of spectrum in hard -to-serve rural markets.  Rather, the Commission should explore ways 
to promote  small and rural carrier participation in primary spectrum auctions.

 When the Commission unleashes spectrum for LTE, 5G, IoT or some future 
paradigm -shifting communications technology, its interest is to make  those airwaves (controlled 
by the American ci tizenry) available for  commercial use and put them t o their best use.  Giving  
carriers like AT&T, Verizon, or T -Mobile an all -you-can-eat voucher at the spectrum buffet  and 
then having rural areas sit idle and unused is not putting spectrum to its best an d highest use .  
Commission policies that encourage spectrum hoarding at the time of initial auction immediately 
put rural markets behind the proverbial eight -ball.  First, those small company and rural market 
carriers that want  to serve small -license -size markets are foreclosed from obtaining licenses to 
serve their target markets because the license sizes created by the Commission are too big.  
Second, the large carriers/licensees, after winning the large licenses at auction, wait to deploy or 
fail to depl oy services in the rural portions of these large -license markets.  Rural consumers fall 
on the wrong side of the digital divide because this problem is repeated time -and-time again, 
whether with Low -Band licenses, Mid -Band licenses, or especially now with High -Band 
licenses.   In order to stop this cyclical problem of rural disenfranchisement and the constant need 
for spectrum leasing, partitioning, and disaggregation, the Commission should dis -incentivize 
large carriers and licensees from acquiring large sw aths of spectrum at every FCC auction, not 
encourage such behavior.   
IV. IF THE COMMISSION ADOPTS REDUCED PERFORMANCE 
REQUIREMENTS, IT SHOULD LIMIT THE BENEFICIARIES TO SMALL 
COMMON CARRIERS IN RURAL MARKETS, AS INTENDED BY 
CONGRESS.  
 
In its NPRM , the Commiss ion asked whether or not it “should consider applying any 
rule revisions stemming from this proceeding to an expanded class of licensees beyond those",4,RWA Spectrum Policies - Reply Comments - FINAL.pdf,THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"6 
 Congress requires it to consider.”10  Congress was abundantly clear in Section 616 of the 
MOBILE NOW Act wh en it directed the Commission to use the definition of “carrier” found in 
Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Act”).11  Indeed, the Commission 
notes that “[a]s a threshold matter, the MOBILE NOW Act directs the Commission to focus on 
programs that would promote spectrum availability for ‘covered small carriers,’ a term that as 
noted above encompasses only common carriers.”12  The legislative intent behind Section 61 6 
could not be clearer , and the Commission in its NPRM  reiterates which services are associated 
with “covered geographic licenses.”13  Nonetheless, several commenters are pushing to expand 
the proposed rules (specifically those that would allow covered small carriers to lease, partition, 
or disaggregate certai n licenses) such that non -common carriers would be included.14  This is 
wrong, not just for the obvious legal reasons , but also  for important policy reasons.  
Both NRECA and WISPA wish to expand the list of entities eligible to benefit from 
revised rules bey ond covered small carriers ( i.e. common carriers).   NRECA correctly 
recognizes that the term “covered small carriers” only encompasses “common carriers,”  and 
excludes “private, internally provided communications ,” Nonetheless , it argues that “[t]he 
Commission should also apply any rule revisions to the use of spectrum to provide advanced

Services).

 telecommunications on a non -common carrier basis and for use of spectrum for  private, internal 
services .”15  Similarly, WISPA has argued that “[l]imiting new rules only to ‘common carriers’ 
would arbitrarily limit the pool of eligible providers, decrease the vibrancy of the secondary 
market for larger licensees, and increase the possibility that rural areas remain unserved.”16  A 
common carrier designation i s not some arbitrary moniker that carries no practical significance.  
Rather, common carriers have a heightened duty compared to other telecommunications service 
providers and are legally obligated to provide American consumers (and other carriers) with 
levels of service and rates that are by their very nature regulated and protected.  This limitation is 
anything but arbitrary.   What NRECA and WISPA are seeking is a fundamental change in the 
use restrictions placed on certain wireless  licenses, and this type of rule change requires a 
dedicated notice -and-comment rulemaking process , especially because Congress did not intend 
for non -common carriers to be eligible in this proceeding .  This proceeding is the wrong vehicle, 
and the arguments put forward by bo th organizations are merely an end -run around well -
established law and Commission rules .  To be clear, nothing today prevents either group’s 
members from acquiring leased, partitioned or disaggregated licenses in the secondary markets - 
- so long as th ose lessees or licensees  follow the rules prescribed for common carriers.  For these 
reasons, the NRECA and WISPA arguments about expanding eligible licensees should be 
rejected .17

 V. ALLOWING UNBRIDLED SPECTRUM TRANSACTIONS IN THE 
SECONDARY MARKETPLACE WILL O NLY ENCOURAGE MORE 
LICENSE ACQUIS ITIONS AND LEASES THAT ARE NOT IN THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST.  
 
As discussed above, the Commission’s daily review o f all proposed license 
transaction s is anything but arbitrary.  Each proposed transaction is reviewed to make sure that it 
is in the public interest.  CTIA has asked the Commission to “[r]emove any barriers to secondary 
market transactions” and streamline the approval process for leases and  transfers.18  While RWA 
does not oppose  CTIA’s proposal for a reduction in oversight on one -to-one spectru m swaps 
when two licensees are trading equal amounts of spectrum in the same band and in the same 
market (provided there are no other extenuating circ umstances), RWA strongly opposes  CTIA ’s 
request  that all spectrum leases only require that the parties provide the Commission with “prior 
notification” instead of gaining actual Commission approval.  Adopting t his particular CTIA 
proposal to remove an alle ged “barrier” to secondary market transactions would be a mistake.   
The Commission’s review of license applications, whether short term leases, spectrum manager 
leases, or de facto  transfer leases, is an important public policy service .  Self-regulation by 
lessors and lessees could lead to questionable commercial transactions, and no advance notice to 
the public or chance for outside parties to submit comment on the proposed applications . At a 
time when CTIA’s members today hold well over 99% of the commercial mobile wireless 
spectrum that would be subject to  these proposed rules, the FCC should,  if anything, pay more  
attention to spectrum transactions, not less.

 VI. CONCLUSION  
 
RWA supports the Commission’s various efforts to put spectrum to good use for the 
American public, including in often -neglected rural markets.  However, the simple solution to 
correcting the problem of FCC licensees unable to build -out networks in a timely man ner lies not 
at the end of a license term, but rather, before licenses are even awarded.  Specifically, the 
Commission needs to create geographic license sizes that are “right sized” and conduct auctions 
that offer  small and rural carriers bidding credits.   This will provide  small, rural carriers  with a 
legitimate opportunity to acquire and build -out wireless licenses in remote and rural markets on a 
timely basis, while simultaneously preventing larger licensees and carriers from hoard ing 
licenses, forcing them to acquire  only those licenses which they truly need and build  out their 
licenses in a timely manner .

REPLY COMMENTS OF  
THE WIRELESS INTERNE T SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION  
The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (“WISPA”) hereby submits its 
Reply Comments in support of certain rule change s proposed in the Notice of Proposed  
Rulemaking (“ NPRM ”) in the above -captioned proceeding.1  Commenters by and large agree 
that modifying  the rules relating to partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing would facilitate 
secondary market transactions  and help spur more efficient and pro -compe titive use of otherwise  
fallow spectrum.2 
Based on the record established by the initial comments, the Commission should expand 
the scope of eligibility describ ed in the NPRM  beyond the confines of Title II “common carriers”  
to include any unaffiliated small or rural service provider  in order to maximize the intended 
public interest benefits of secondary market transactions .  The Commission also should afford 
flexibility to both parties to  such transaction s to reasonably reduce their perform ance 
requirements  and encourage deployment of service that will help close the digital divide .

 However, permit ting reaggregation of smaller licenses would defeat the purpose of the policy 
goals intended by the MOBILE NOW Act and could enable gaming of the  market .  Finally, the 
Commission should streamline secondary market approval procedures , but should not abdicate 
its statutory responsibility to review assignee s’ qualifications .   
Discussion  
I. THE COMMISSION SHOUL D APPLY ITS REVISED  RULES BROADLY  TO 
BOTH C ARRIERS AND OTHER SE RVICE PROVIDERS  
A number of  commenters agree that the Commission should not limit the scope of the 
secondary market incentives intended by the MOBILE NOW Act to “common carriers” alone , 
and no commenter appears to oppose a more inclusiv e definition .3  As WISPA explained in its 
Comments, applying the rules more broadly as a means of fostering “the availability of advanced 
communications” in “rural areas” would be consistent with Congressional objectives.  
Restricting  the benefits and build -out incentives only to established “carriers” would artificially 
limit the market for spectrum licensees  that wish to disaggregate, partition, or lease spectrum to 
smaller rural providers .4  Consistent with the record, the Commissio n should adopt the specific 
definitions of “unaffiliated covered small carrier” and “unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area”  
WISPA has proposed.5 
In support of a more exp ansive definition of the eligible entities, t he National Rural 
Electric Cooperativ e Association (“NRECA”) points out  that limiting the intended  benefits to 
“common carriers ” would adversely affect deployment of evolving “Smart Grid” technologies 
that require the use of internal, non -common carrier based services to function and serve th e

 public.6  As NRECA puts it , “commercial carrier services often do not adequately cover the rural 
and remote areas served by electric coops.”7  
Midcontinent Communications agree s that a narrow definition of “carrier” would 
unnecessarily limit the effectiv eness and reach of the rules .8  It explains that the process of 
becoming a Title II “ common carrier ” imposes obligations that can make it more difficult to 
provide service rural areas that most need access to broadband.  Further, a  limited pool of small 
and rural carriers will mean fewer options for larger carriers that wish to disaggregate , partition , 
or lease  their spectrum , and will do little to encourage deployment of new technologies  and 
services  to rural areas.  
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 makes it the policy of the United States to 
encourage new technologies and services to the public.9  A number of  commenters demonstrated 
that there is no public policy reason for the Commission to limit arbitrarily the pool of eligible 
providers to only “common carriers ,” and that doing so would run counter to the stated policy of 
encouraging  the provision of  new technologies and services to the public.10  
The record and Commission policy strongly support definitions of “unaffiliated covered 
small car rier” and “unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area” that include entities that are not Title 
“common carriers.”  The Commission should adopt the definitions of proposed by WISPA that 
will not  “limit the pool of providers, decrease the vibrancy of the se condary market, and increase 
the possibility that rural areas will remain unserved.”11

 II. COMMENTERS AGREE THA T THE COMMISSION SHO ULD PROVIDE 
INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE  SECONDARY MARKET  TRANSACTIONS  
All c omment ers agree with WISPA that the Commission should adopt  rules  “encouraging 
licensees to lease or sell spectrum”  to facilitate deployment to rural and underserved areas .12 
However, the Commission should exercise caution and not award outsized benefits to incumbent 
licensees .13  
Some Commenters suggest that the Commission should allow opportunistic use of 
licensed spectrum to promote  secondary market transactions.14  Open Technology Institute  and 
Public Knowledge support a “use  it or share  it” framework to “ensure licensees cannot 
warehouse spectr um indefinitely or exclude potential rural ISPs able to make use of that 
spectrum. . . .”  Dynamic Spectrum Alliance likewise favors  a “use  it or share  it” framework to 
reduce spectrum warehousing, encourage secondary market transactions by facilitating pr ice 
discovery, and lower barriers for to entry for “innovative new use case by parties.”15 Taking a 
different tack, NTCA suggest s a “keep what you use ” requirement for licenses issued ten or more 
years ago that “do not include construction benchmarks.”16 
Based on its review of the record, WISPA maintains its belief that, instead of adopting 
either  “use it or share  it” or a “keep  what  you use” rules , the Commission should employ both 
                                                 
12 See NPRM  at 8 (¶25).  See, e.g., NTCA Comments at 2 -4 (urging  a “use -it-or-lose-it” framework for 
certain licenses); CCA Comments at 2 -3 (Commission should adopt modified performance requirements 
or license terms for licensees that buy or lease spectrum); DSA Comments at 7 -10 (Commission should 
extend its “use-it-or-share -it fram ework to promote the use of spectrum and encourage secondary 
markets); Open Technology Institute at 6 -8 (Commission should use a “use -or-share” framework to allow 
for opportunistic spectrum access).

prevent waste” by making spectrum available quickly to other users instead of allowing it to remain 
fallow until lost) .

 mechanisms.17  Assuming that licensees will build out to urban “donut holes” first, allowing 
opportunistic use will either encourage the licensee to cover the outer “donut” areas to avoid the 
future loss of market coverage .  It will also establish the opportunistic user s as likely purchasers 
of the spectrum, a better outcome for the incumbent licensee than forfeiting the license under a  
more -restrictive  “keep what you use” approach.   
A number of  commenters suggest at least some flexibility in the buildout and 
performanc e requirements  applicable to small and rural providers engaging in secondary market 
transactions .18  By contrast, the Rural Wireless Association and others argue that the 
Commission should not extend buildout deadlines out of fear that it will result in spe ctrum 
warehousing.19  WISPA generally supports some flexibility in the buildout requirements, but 
cautions that the Commission should be wary of unintentionally incentivizing “license -
flipping.”20  More specifically, a s WISPA stated in its initial comments, the Commission should 
give secondary market licensees the option of either two additional years to construct or use of 
non-population -based performance requirements to demonstrate substantial service.21  Similarly, 
CCA “generally supports strong buildout requirements, some flexibility to the requirements . . . 
will help account for the unique circumstances associated with receiving partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses.”22  CTIA also agrees that the Commission should provide a brief 
extension to a receiving  party when the transaction “occurs late in a license  term – e.g., within 
one or two years of the construction deadline  . . . .”23  Although  CTIA argues that the extension 
                                                 
17 See WISPA Comme nts at 7.  
18 See, e.g., CCA Comments at  3-6; CTIA Comments at 11; Google Comments at 17 (extended buildout 
timeframes could be an incentive to licensees that free spectrum in the “opportunity zone”).

 should be limited to requests filed no later than six months before the construction deadline to 
prevent eleventh -hour filings as a way to avoid loss of a license,24 WISPA believes that CTIA’s 
suggested approach would impose an unnecessarily  restrictive general prohibition as an 
overbroad means of preventing  what are likely to be relatively  rare occurrences . If a large carrier 
is incentivized to lease spectrum before it reverts to the Commission , it is likely to pursue this 
approach  earlier in its license term and realize some benefit from the spectrum .  
This incentive should not be unlimite d.  A  receiving licensee should not be afforded both 
extended buildout obligations and modified performance requirements  but should have the 
option  of one of these inducements  to encourage secondary market transactions and rural 
broadband expansion.  CTIA argues that to allow for  reduced performance requirements for the 
leasing or receiving entity  would be unfair because affording the  original licensee such 
incentives might promote the same result .25  CTIA further asserts  that reducing the requirements  
does nothing to bridge the digital divide but instead benefits only the receiving licensee.26 This 
argument fails to acknowledge that a small carrier likely has not planned or budgeted for license 
acquisition or buildout during the incumbent’s license term .  In these cases, adhering to the 
incumbent’s buildout deadlines will act as a disincentive to small and rural carriers that need 
time to acquire the resources to construct and initiate operations.  By making performance 
requirements  more lenient , the Com mission can  promote greater interest among small and rural 
carriers to acquire disaggregated, partitioned or leased spectrum in unserved rural areas .27 
In addition, as WISPA stated in its Comments, the Commission should impose a 
minimum holding period for l icenses obtained via p artitioning or disaggregation at least until the

 receiving licensee has met the applicable buildout requirement for the license .28 As WISPA 
previously argued, this will incentivize faster buildout and curb the potential for license -flipping 
from an initial purchaser to another service provider.29 This approach will incentivize leasing to 
small and rural providers that are most eager to provide broadband in their communities .  
Similarly, t he Commission should not permit reaggregation of licenses, despite  the 
contrary views of a few commenters that support such transactions .30  The goal s of secondary 
market transactions should be  two-fold.  First,  to create new opportunities for smaller and rural 
service providers ; and second, to allow larg e providers to benefit f rom isolating a portion of a 
license to allow smaller and rural service providers to use the spectrum in lieu of  returning it to 
the Commission  where it could lie fallow for some time .31 Reaggregation would defeat these 
critical goals32 and potentially  lead to gamesmanship33 or spectrum warehousing by larger 
providers.34  Once established, smaller license areas that are “right-sized” to meet the n eeds of 
rural consumers should not be permitt ed to be simply reabsorbed by large carriers into wide -area 
licenses .  Such “pass -throughs” would undermine  the purposes intended by the MOBILE NOW 
Act, leading to reduced service to small and rural communities due to the amassing of spectrum 
rights by lar ge operators ill -suited and unaccustomed to meeting the unique and varied needs of 
such populations .

warehousing by partitioning of non -desirable or hard to serve spectrum to avoid buildout dates  and then

"8 
 WISPA therefore encourages the Commission to permit small and rural providers to have 
a two -year buildout extension or, alternatively,  to permit the acquir ing provider to use  non-
population -based performance requirements.   The Commission also should impose a minimum 
holding period for all partitioned or disaggregated licenses and should not permit reaggregation.    
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD CREATE A MORE  EFFICIENT PROCESS FO R 
SECONDARY MARKET TRA NSACTIONS  
Commenters in this proceeding are in near -unanimous agreement that the Commission’s 
secondary market transaction approval process can and should be made more efficient.  WISPA 
supports this view, with the  understanding that  the Commission should retain necessary 
oversight of the approval process and not complete ly offload responsibility for the partitioning, 
disaggregation , and leasing process  to private entities  alone . 
WISPA believes that the Commission s hould relax its filing requirements and apply 
notification35 and immediate application approval procedures similar to those it uses for 
spectrum manager and short -term leasing arrangements.  As WISPA stated in its initial 
Comments, the Commission could requ ire certification s from the parties that they are either an 
unaffiliated covered small carrier or an unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area and to certify that 
the transaction is within the Commission rules.36 There is simply no need for a public notice  and 
30-day comment period for basic secondary market transactions. Necessary public disclosure and 
agency oversight can be maintained using substantially simplified mechanisms.  
Many commenters agree that the Commission should apply either its immediate ap proval 
procedures or a similar  automated approval procedure  for secondary market transactions. For 
example , CTIA contends that  the Commission should allow for either simple  notification to the

 Commission or, alternatively , the existing  immediate approval p rocedures to apply to secondary 
market filings that meet eligibility requirements established by the Commission’s rules.37 Select 
Spectrum agrees that the Commission should utiliz e its immediate approval process for less 
complex transactions to “facilitate more and faster spectrum transactions.”38  Google 
recommends the use of an automated system as a means of increasing participation similar to the 
SAS that has been utilized by CBRS band.39  These commenters and WISPA all agree that the 
Commission should impl ement a procedure that speeds up the approval process of secondary 
market transactions as a way to lower transaction costs  and accelerate service .  
Some commenters suggest the use of an automated database40 as a way to reduce costs 
and stimulate the seconda ry market.  WISPA oppose s R Street Institute’s proposal to employ an 
automated database  to the extent that process would be  a replacement for the Commission ’s 
spectrum management function and a substitute for approving the qualifications of parties to the 
secondary transactions to alienate and to hold Commission authorizations .41  Among other 
things, Commission oversight is necessary to determine if the unaffiliated “carriers” participating 
in the transactions meet Commission eligibility requirements and to ensure that there is no 
impermissible reaggregation of spectrum to a larger carrier.   
Conclusion  
 
 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Commission  should adopt the broad definitions of 
“unaffiliated covered small carrier” and “unaffiliated carrier to ser ve a rural market” proposed in 
the WISPA Comments.  The Commission also should afford  flexibility to both parties to  a

Commission should not permit reaggregation as it wo uld run counter to the policy goals of 
expanding opportunities for small and  rural providers .  Finally, the Commission should 
streamline its secondary market procedures but should not cede management of the process  to 
third parties .

REPLY COMMENTS OF RS ACCESS, LLC  
 
RS Access, LLC (“RS Access”) files these reply comments in response to the Federal 
Communications Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ( “NPRM”) seeking comment 
on potential changes to the Commission’s partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules .1  RS 
Access urges the Commission to adopt rules that would permit licensees , including Multichannel 
Video and Data Distribution Service (“MVDDS”) licensees operating in the 12.2 -12.7 GHz band 
(“12 GHz band”) , to disa ggreg ate and aggregate spectrum  as well as partition or aggregate  
license areas .  Increas ing the flexibility of MVDDS licensees  and similarly situated parties to 
organize their licenses based on the needs of a dynamic commercial wireless market would 
reduce com pliance costs, simplify secondary  market transactions, and “free up mid -band 
spectrum for wireless innovation ,”2 thereby benefit ting consumers and businesses alike.

 I. Permitting MVDDS licensees to disaggregate their spectrum holdings will increase 
small and  rural carriers’ access to spectrum.  
Under the Commission’s rules, MVDDS licensees may partition spectrum but are 
prohibited from disaggregating spectrum .3  MVDDS licensees currently share the 12 GHz band 
on a co -primary basis with Direct Broadcast Satelli te (“DBS”) and Non -Geostationary Orbit 
Fixed -Satellite Service (“NGSO FSS”) operations .  Citing the co -primary allocations in the band, 
the FCC  prohibit ed spectrum  disaggregation  on grounds that “the increase in possible 
interference [was] too great” and that “permitting disaggregation would make it difficult to 
determine which licensee is causing the interference problem.”4  Neither of these factors appl ies 
today.  Changes in technology play an especially important role in the Commission’s need to 
revisit  its 2002 decision to prohibit  the disaggregation of MVDDS spectrum.   
At the physical layer, MVDDS equipment has become much easier to deploy and align.  
For example, n ew equipment  has narrower, targeted beam apertures that allow for highly focused  
links , and current -generation transmitters allow for a high degree of customization and can create 
dedicated bandwidth for each customer site .  At the software layer, MVDDS licensees have 
many more tools to identify, avoid , and (if necessary ) remediate interfere nce than existed  nearly 
twenty years ago.  Even under the Commission’s cumbersome MVDDS coordination 
procedures,5 the global availability of high -resolution airborne imagery throughout the United 
States has made site access and coordination extremely  manag eable.  Likewise, t he ability of 
                                                 
3 See 47 C.F.R. § 101.1415(a)  (“MVDDS licensees are permitted to partition licensed geographic 
areas along county borders (Parishes in Louisiana or Territories in Alaska).  Disaggregation will 
not be permitted by MVDDS li censees in the 12.2 -12.7 GHz band.”) .

 licensees to track and manage their spectrum holdings has radically improved.  W hen the 
Commission adopted its prohibition on disaggregation of MVDDS spectrum  in 2002 , “Clippy ,” 
the unsolicited paper clip office assistan t, was still making appearances in Microsoft  Excel , and 
datasets were limited to 16,384 rows .  By comparison, t oday’s commercial spreadsheets 
regularly handle datasets of more than 1 million rows and feature more advance features that 
allow easy a ccess to information.  Concerns about equipment performance or tracking that may 
have existed in 2002, when the Commission adopted its MVDDS rules,  are no longer relevant in 
2019 .  Multiple generations of equipment improvements and the advent of free or off -the-shelf 
software allow a licensee to identify, track , and manage whatever disaggregation  a spectrum 
licensee might adopt .   
While the Commission  has expanded flexible -use licensing  and steadily increased access 
to tools that make government -issued licen ses more relevant to the commercial marketplace ,6 the 
rules governing MVDDS reflect a technology landscape  that is  more than 17 years old.  When it 
implemented the MVDDS rules in 2002, the FCC acknowledged that “flexible” partitioning rules 
create incentiv es “by which smaller or newly formed entities can gain access to the broadband 
wireless market.”7  This principle equally applies to disaggregation.  Relieving MVDDS 
licensees of the prohibition on disaggregation would  provide MVDDS licensees with addition al 
flexibility  to achieve the Commission’s goals, namely  “to close the digital divide and to increase 
spectrum access by small and rural carriers .”8

making spectrum available for new wireless uses while balancing desired speed to the market 
[and] efficiency of use.”).

 As RS Access has stated in other proceedings, the 12 GHz band “has the necessary 
bandwidth (500 megahertz) and favorable propagation characteristics to accommodate 
innovative, two -way terrestrial services.”9  Small and rural carriers, however, may not need  – or 
be able to afford – 500 megahertz in a given county .  While small and rural carriers could  
ostensibly purchase mid -band spectrum from other licensees, the “all -or-nothing” nature of 
purchasing spectrum from MVDDS licensees on a county (or greater) basis limits  the supply of 
mid-band spectrum available to small and rural carriers.   The Commissio n’s prohibition on 
disaggregation artificially increases  the price for mid -band spectrum , discouraging investment in 
(and use of) the 12 GHz  band by small and rural carriers .  By extension, t hese disincentives limit 
“new opportunities for flexible broadban d use in the mid -band frequencies . . . well -suited for 
next-generation wireless services”10 and harm competition .  Providing MVDDS licensees with 
the ability to disaggregate their holdings would increase the likelihood that small and rural 
carriers co uld invest in mid -band spectrum, capitalize on the 12 GHz band’s  favorable 
propagation characteristics , offer robust mobile broadband or innovative 5G services, and 
increase competition .     
II. Partitioning and disaggregation rules should permit aggregation of lic enses that 
were not previously partitioned or disaggregated.  
RS Access agrees with CTIA that  “the Commission should adopt a simple, uniform 
process by which licensees can easily and quickly notify Commission staff that a licensee has 
reaggregated its licen se.”11  Such a process should also apply to MVDDS licensees.   By

 standardizing the process, the Commission also would reduce the number of issued  licenses .  
Reducing the number of unnecessar ily issued  licenses  would  ease licensees’ regulatory and 
administrative burdens  (e.g., “construction requirements, renewal demonstrations, continuous 
service requirements, and the need to maintain up -to-date information in ULS” ).12  These 
burdens impose unnecessary costs on the licensee , diverting service providers’  attention and 
resources away from investing in their networks  and providing more robust mobile broadband or 
next-generation wireless services .   
These regulatory and administrative burdens  also “hamper the development and us e of 
secondary spectrum markets” by imposing transaction costs on buyers and sellers.13  These 
transaction costs make it more difficult for a buyer and seller to negotiate the “ideal allocation of 
spectrum rights.”14  By increasing licensees’ flexibility (including MVDDS licensees’ flexibility ) 
to disaggregate or aggregate spectrum  and partition or aggregate license areas , the Commission 
can reduce unnecessary, inefficient transaction costs and effectively “catalyz[e] [the] secondary 
markets .”15 
RS Access stresses that the Commission’s rules should not restrict  aggregation  to 
instances  where the licensee is  merely  reaggregating previously disaggregated  or partitioned  
spectrum.  Instead, the rules should permit the  aggregation of licenses that were not previously 
disaggregated  or partitioned , provided a licensee has satisfied the substantial service 
requirements for each of the licenses .  Increasing licensees’ flexibility to aggregate spectrum  or 
geography,  regardless of a license’s history,  would incre ase licensees’  ability to efficiently

 maximize their spectrum holdings.   These benefits would extend to  all stakeholders in the 
secondary market, including small and rural carriers.    
The Commission  has rightly expressed concern that unscrupulous licensees  might use 
partitioning and disaggregation to diminish or evade otherwise binding  construction 
obligations .16  For this reason, a ny flexibility the Commission grants to licensees  to partition and 
disaggregate their spectrum must have no effect on the popula tion or coverage requirements that 
any given licensee must meet as a term of their license.  While parties can debate measures to 
combat potential evasion of buildout obligations, no concerns about evasion of existing 
deployment obligations occur when “the licensee has already  met its construction obligations .”17  
At a minimum, therefore, a licensee that has fully satisfied all elements of its  substantial service 
showing should be permitted to aggregate as well as disaggregate and partition its Commission -
issued spectrum licenses .   
III. CONCLUSION  
No reasonable basis exists to withhold the same disaggregation , partitioning, or 
aggregation  rules that apply to other terrestrial wireless services from operators in the MVDDS 
band.  The Commission’s current disaggregation  policies have artificially restricted the supply of 
spectrum by imposing regulatory and transactional costs on both licensees and potential 
licensees.  These policies have hampered the secondary market’s development and, by extension, 
discou raged competition from small and rural carriers .

 To maintain U.S. leadership in 5G, Chairman Pai has identified the need to make  
spectrum more available  and modernize outdated regulations.18  In this proceeding, the 
Commission  has an opportunity  to do bot h, especially by  refresh ing outdated  MVDDS 
disaggregation rules.   Accordingly, RS Access urges the Commission to  adopt rules that would 
permit licensees  – including MVDDS licensees – to disaggregate and aggregate spectrum  or 
partition and aggregate license  areas .  Applying current -generation  rules to MVDDS would place 
MVDDS licensees on equal footing with other operators in the market .  Updated rules  would 
also create much -needed flexibility for licensees to maximize the value of their spectrum 
holdings and  sell spectrum to potential licensees that value it more  highly .  These efficiencies 
would benefit all stakeholders, including small and rural carriers, and therefore serve the 
Commission’s “continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to increase sp ectrum access by 
small and rural carriers.”19

REPLY COMMENTS OF MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS  
 Midcontinent Communications (Midco) supports the Commission taking action to allow 
for more robust partitioning, disaggregation, and licensing and leasing of spectrum, especially in 
rural areas.1  Midco submitted brief initial comments to  highlight a particular area of concern—
limiting future partition and disaggregation rules to “carriers.”2  We similarly limit our reply 
comments, especially because one of our trade associations, the Wireless Internet Service 
Providers Association (WISPA), has provided an in- depth analysis on the proposed rules;3 an 
analysis that we adopt herein.   
DISCUSSION  
 The MOBILE NOW Act requires the Commission to consider whether new partitioning 
or disaggregation of spectrum could “ increase availability  of advanced telecommunications 
services in rural areas and spectrum access by small carriers.”4  The term “carrier” implies that a 
company needs eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) status or a Certificate of Authority to

 benefit from the new spectrum licensing and leasing rules.5  As explained in our ini tial 
comments, ETC status can be complicated, even for a CLEC like Midco.6  We, therefore, 
requested that the Commission expand the classes of companies that will be eligible to 
participate in any new rules beyond those entities that are “common carriers.”    Overwhelming ly, other commentators agreed that the Commission should encourage 
more companies to participate in the new rules.
7  Federated Wireless, for example, argued that it 
is “imperative that the Commission use all of the tools at its disposal to better facilitate 
secondary markets transactions to ensure spectrum access is promptly enabled for all users who 
need it, such as rural and small carriers, particularly as the roll -out of 5G service rapidly 
approaches.”8  
Google similarly argued: “Consiste nt with the Congressional direction in the MOBILE NOW 
Act, the Commission should continue its efforts to stimulate secondary markets due to their potentially critical role in maintaining efficient spectrum and wireless markets.  Leveraging 
secondary market s to put underutilized or unused spectrum resources to work for the American 
                                                           
5 Midco Initial Comments at 3 -4 (“Midco is concerned about the term ‘carrier,’ specifically in 
the ‘unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area’ in Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act.  ‘Carrier’ 
implies that only companies that are covered common carriers pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 would be able to benefit from the part ition and disaggregation rules.”)  
6 Id. at 4-5.   
7 See e.g. , NRECA Comments at 7 (“The Commission should also apply any rule revisions to the 
use of spectrum to provide advanced telecommunications on a non- common carrier basi s and for 
use of spectrum for private, internal purposes.”);  CTIA Comments at 2 & 4 (broadly arguing that 
the Commission should “[r]emove any barriers to secondary market transactions” and citing numerous examples of leases to non- carriers);  and Google Comments at 3 ( “shuffling spectru m 
resources between carriers does not alone maximize the availability and beneficial use of spectrum. In particular, the secondary market has been less than effective in making underutilized spectrum available for new innovations and use cases” ).

 people should remain a paramount goal.”9  Other commentators went further and argued for even 
more robust rules to encourage participation in the new licensing and leasing rules.10  
 An essential element to encourage more companies to benefit from any new licensing and 
leasing rules is to more  broadly define “carrier.”  The Commission could, for example,11 extend 
eligibility to service provider s that are incumbent or competitive loca l exchange companies , 
cable television system operator s, or terrestrial fixed wireless provider s (including wireless ISPs, 
or WISPs).   
 As WISPA argued , the Commission has the authority to expand the definition of “ carrier” 
and allow entities other than c ommon carriers to participate from the rules:  
 Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act provides that a “covered small 
carrier” permitted to obtain spectrum through secondary market transactions is “a 
carrier … as defined in section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934” that meets 
certain size parameters (i.e., not more than 1,500 employees) and provides 
services using its own facilities.   In carrying out its public interest mandate, 
however, the Commission need not limit the scope of its inquiry and its 
fashioning of new secondary market incentives to “common carriers” alone.  
Indeed, it would be entirely consistent with the stated Congressional objectives 
underlying Section 616 to apply the rules more broadly as a means of better 
fostering “the availability of advanced telecommunicati ons services” in “rural 
areas.”  Strictly limiting the benefits and build -out incentives to established

10 See, e.g., Comments of New America’s Open Technology Institute and Public Knowledge, at 
2 & 9 (“historically, large carriers acquire licenses for large areas, build out in the urban core where the population is more dense, and warehouse spectrum in rural areas that could be used for broadband deployment. The largest carriers have a history of warehousing spectrum and leaving it fallow rather than making it available for use to catalyz e broadband deployment or other 
services. For licensees, there are no obvious incentives to share or partition their spectrum absent specific rules such as use -or-share. . . . OTI and PK urge the Commission to adopt use -it-or-
share- it rules for all exclusively -licensed IMT bands to promote more intensive use of the 
spectrum, as well as stronger incentives and mechanisms to encourage secondary market transactions.” (internal citations omitted)) ; Dynamic Spectrum Alliance Comments at 7 -12

11 The example provided herein is only one suggestion of how the Commission could expand 
eligibility for the new rules.",2,Midco.Secondary Markets.Reply.Comments 7.1.2019.pdf,MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 “carriers” would exclude many broadband providers that are not deemed at this 
time to be “common carriers,” and would provide fe wer options for larger carriers 
wishing to disaggregate, partition, or lease spectru m to rural providers. . . .  
 
 The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”) provides the 
Commission ample authority to adopt broader benefits extending to any ser vice 
provider capable of bringing the benefits of “advanced telecommunications” to 
unserved and underserved rural consumers. The Commission can rely on the same 
array of statutory authorities that it used to adopt the initial secondary markets 
regulations in 2003 to expand the intended benefits outlined in the MOBILE 
NOW Act.  In particular, Section 7(a) of the Act establishes that “it shall be the 
policy of the United States to encourage the provision of new technologies and 
services to the public.”  The T elecommunications Act of 1996 further highlights 
the desire to “promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower 
prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers 
and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies.”    
And the 1997 Balanced Budget Act affords the Commission explicit authority to allocate electromagnetic spectrum to promote the most efficient use of the spectrum, which would include such measures as permitting the creation of  
smaller geographic areas and spectrum assignments through secondary market transactions to facilitate improved service to the public.  The Commission also can rely on the recodification of Section 257 of the Act in RAY BAUM’s Act, which is intended to support investment by small companies and entrepreneurs generally, a category that would include rural broadband providers.
12 
 
 By more broadly defining  “carrier ,” the Commission can allow providers to take 
advantage of the proposed spectrum leasing and licens ing rule changes , and increase the 
availability of advanced telecommunications services for all Americans.

REPLY COMMENTS OF FEDERATED WIRELESS, INC.  
 
Federated Wireless, Inc.  (“Federated Wireless ”) hereby replies to the comments submitted in 
response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”)  issued by the Federal Communications 
Commission (“Commission”)  in the above -captioned proceeding.1  Federated Wireless is pleased that the 
record in this proceeding demonstrates the immense potential for voluntary, database -enabled, automated 
tools to reduce transaction costs in the secondary market for spectrum acce ss and thereby facilitate more 
streamlined access by those who need it.  Federated Wireless thus encourages the Commission to further 
leverage these tools to incent greater use of the Commission’s secondary markets mechanisms, including 
in ways that enhanc e spectrum access for small and rural carriers.  
I. THE RECORD DEMONSTRATES THAT AN AUTOMATED, VOLUNT ARY 
SECONDARY MARKETS DATABASE TOOL WOULD  REDUCE 
TRANSACTION COSTS AND FACILITATE MORE FRICTIONLESS 
SPECTRUM ACCESS FOR SMALL AND RURAL CARRIERS AND OTHER 
PROSPECTIVE  USERS . 
A broad cross -section  of commenters agreed with Federated Wireless that there are significant 
transaction costs associated with the negotiation and implementation of secondary markets transactions 
today, which create disincentives to lease or sell spectrum use rights.2  For example, as Google LLC 
(“Google”) explained, “ Transaction costs in secondary spectrum markets take several forms. Simply

"2 finding what spectrum resources are available is often a challenge for potential buyers.”3  The O pen 
Technology Institute at New America  and Public Knowledge (together, “OTI/PK”) similarly noted that 
transaction costs are increased by “the difficulty potential buyers face in finding information about 
available spectrum where they need it. There is no database of available spectrum by geographic area” 
and further observed that “[a] nother obstacle exacerbated by the opaque and one -off nature of secondary 
market transactions are the administrative process and the complex and costly negotiations for second ary 
rights .”4  In light of the transaction costs presently deterring parties from entering into secondary market 
agreements, Federated Wireless agrees with CTIA that “reducing procedural burdens and creating 
additional flexibility in the Commission’s rules  could further facilitate secondary market transactions to 
the benefit of smaller carriers, particularly in rural areas. ”5  In particular, the record in this proceeding 
shows that the Commission could best provide this needed flexibility and reduce transac tion costs by 
leveraging voluntary, automated, database -enabled solutions to streamline secondary market transactions 
while enabling the Commission to more efficiently execute its oversight responsibilities.  
To provide such flexibility, c ommenters agreed w ith Federated Wireless that the Commission 
should leverage automated, database- enabled tools to facilitate more streamlined secondary markets 
transactions between licensees and prospective users.  Google correctly observed that “[d] atabase systems

"3 database- enable d secondary markets tool could “draw on actual usage information submitted by licensees 
and lessees in accordance with Commission rules, and be algorithmically programmed to recognize 
priority spectrum rights and/or sharing rules, as well as possible compl ementary uses. Furthermore, 
licensees interested in placing additional spectrum in the secondary market could provide the exchange 
administrator with information for inclusion in the database, such as protection/availability criteria or 
conditions like a t erm of years or other reversion criteria under which the licensee could retake the 
spectrum.”9  In this way, the administrator of the database could calculate what spectrum is available in 
what locations, and publish aggregated, anonymized and obfuscated s pectrum availability information 
that would not reveal any radio-  or licensee- specific data.  I n so doing , the administrator of such an 
automated, voluntary secondary markets database would  significantly reduce transaction costs by 
providing transparency t o both licensees and prospective users as to the availability of suitable secondary 
markets transaction partners in a given area.10 
Such an approach would be far more effective in reducing transaction costs and incenting 
increased use of the Commission’s secondary markets mechanisms than standalone updates to certain 
Commission systems, as advocated by some commenters.  CTIA argues that the Commission should 
“consider, as it continues to modernize ULS, ways to make licensing information already available in its 
database more accessible to small and rural carriers. ”11  While enhancing the accuracy and transparency 
of information housed in Commission databases is a laudable goal and may simplify the process of 
identifying where spectrum is licensed and to whom, it is likely to have little effect on the transaction 
costs currently stifling the secondary market for spectrum access.  This is the case because improvements 
to ULS would provide no additional information to prospective users about where and on what term s 
spectrum rights are available  for lease or transfer in accordance the Commission’s secondary markets 
rules.  Prospective users would therefore continue to be burdened with the need to locate a licensee that is

"4 potentially willing to make some of its spectrum available for use, initiate and successfully conclude 
negotiations to obtain rights to such use, and thereafter file and prosecute the necessary applications for 
Commission consent to the transaction.  By contrast, a voluntary secondary markets databa se of the type 
described by Federated Wireless in its initial comments would effectively automate the process of 
identifying counterparties and negotiating an appropriate agreement , helping licensees monetize their 
unused or little -used spectrum with little corresponding cost and significantly reducing the burdens on 
prospective users associated with assessing the availability of spectrum to meet their needs.  Moreover, an

spectrum and geographic areas covered by the transaction —and prov ide such information to the 
Commission via an interface with ULS .  Just as the database could automate modifications to the 
secondary market agreements— e.g., in terms of the covered geography or spectrum —so, too, could it 
automatically report updated infor mation reflecting such modifications to the Commission.  It is thus 
clear that an automated, voluntary secondary markets database would be the most efficient and effective 
means of reducing the administrative burdens on licensees, prospective users, and the Commission that 
are currently associated with secondary markets transactions.  T he Commission should therefore leverage 
such database- enabled tools to facilitate far more robust, streamlined use of the Commission’s secondary

(together, t he “Rural Carriers ”), by their counsel,  hereby reply  to comments in response to the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (“NPRM ”) in the above -captioned proceeding ,1 in which the 
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) is considering modifying  its 
existing rules for partition ing, disaggregating, and leasing spectrum licenses in order to promote 
the provision of service to rural areas and to increase access to spectrum by small, rural carriers , 
as directed by the Making Opportunities for Broadband Investment and Limiting Excess ive and

The Rural Carriers agree that “[p] olicies that provide flexibility to partition and 
disaggregate spectrum will promote opportunities for carriers to acquire spectrum in a particular 
geograph ic area and enhance buildout efforts .”3  The Rural Carriers generally support  the 
position of the Competitive Carriers Association (“ CCA ”) that the Commission should  extend

future licensing proceedings on a band -specific basis , but should  not be applied retr oactively as 
new conditions on  previously  issued  licenses .  The retroactive  application of such increased 
requirements would frustrate  the purpose of this proceeding  and would adversely affect small

requirements may result in the return of economically marginal areas that may someday be re -
licensed, but that are more like ly be served by expansion by the existing licensee over time as 
technology and economics justify.  Increased  performance requirements can inherently 
disadvantage  small companies who have limited resources.  The retroactive application of 
heightened require ments may derail  a small compan y’s business plan .  One commenter 
recommends adopting new construction benchmarks that mirror the 700 MHz performance 
requirements,10 but the struggle to meet those benchmarks  experienced by  many small, rural 700 
MHz licensees  exemplifies  the real challenge that meeting significant geographic  coverage 
requirements can present for a small provider  trying to serve difficult and expensive to serve 
rural areas .  Therefore, t he Commission should refrain from retroactively adopting a ny such 
increased performance requirements for previously issued licenses because it would likely 
function as a substantive barrier to rural companies  contrary  to the purpose of this proceeding .

COMMENTS OF FEDERATED WIRELESS, INC.  
 
Federated Wireless, Inc.  (“Federated Wireless ”) hereby submits its comments in response to the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”)  issued by the Federal Communications Commission 
(“Commission”)  in the above -captione d proceeding.1  Federated Wireless commends the Commission for 
its ongoing efforts to ensure that valuable spectrum resources are made available to those who will 
expeditiously put spectrum to productive use, particularly in unserved and underserved rural areas.  
Federated Wireless encourages the Commission to use this proceeding to evaluate the use of available 
technology and tools to drastically reduce the transaction costs associated with the secondary spectrum 
market today and simplify the process for both licensees and prospective users, thus ensuring that the 
secondary spectrum market  is as robust as possible and that it facilitates access for a wide variety of 
users.   In particular, the Commission should exa mine the use of a voluntary, database -enabled  approach, 
which  would : (1) significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with the negotiation and 
implementation of secondary market agreements, thereby facilitating greater use of the Commission’s 
secondary market mechanisms, and (2) streamline the Commission’s performance of its spectrum 
management, licensing, and oversight obligations.  
I. THE TRANSACTION COSTS OF  NEGOTIATING AND IMP LEMENTING 
SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE EXISTING 
PROCESSES CREATE DISINCENTIVES  TO LEASE OR SELL SP ECTRUM 
USE RIGHTS . 
As the Commission acknowledges, under the current secondary market s rules there exist 
“substantive [and] procedural barriers to leasing [and sales] that inefficiently limit the use of the program

"2 by spectrum licensees,” such as the lengthy process to initiate negotiations to reach an agreement for a 
transaction that complies with Commission’s rules, prepare and file applications for Commission 
approval  thereof, and then to await the Commission’s rev iew and disposition of such applications.2  This 
process obviously introduces friction at multiple points along the way :  (a) identifying where suitable 
spectrum might be available for use pursuant to a secondary market transaction ; (b) initiating, conduct ing, 
and concluding  negotiations with the relevant licensee ; (c) preparing and submitting the applications for 
Commission consent ; and ( d) awaiting Commission action on such applications.  Licensees must 
therefore weigh the significant administrative burde ns and cost s of working through the secondary 
markets process, as well as the potential impact of such transactions on network and business planning, 
against the expected benefits associated with a transaction.  Too often, the burdensome nature of the 
process skews this cost -benefit analysis against engaging in such transactions.   
Such inefficiencies  and their effect on the likelihood of success in negotiating a secondary market 
agreement for spectrum access are particularly problematic for small and rural  carriers.  These spectrum  
users are generally less likely to have the resources to obtain geographic area licenses at auction and are 
thus more likely to be disproportionately dependent on obtaining spectrum use rights through the 
secondary market to support their business needs and serve their customers.  I t is therefore imperative that 
the Commission use all of the tools at its disposal to better facilitate  secondary markets transactions to 
ensure spectrum access is promptly enabled for all users who need it, such as rural and small carriers, 
particularly as the roll -out of 5G service rapidly approaches.  
II. THE COMMISSION SHOUL D USE A VOLUNTARY, DATABASE -ENABLED 
APPROACH TO AUTOMATE  CRITICAL STEPS OF S ECONDARY MARKET 
TRANSACTIONS AND FACILITATE MORE FRICTIO NLESS SPECTRUM 
ACCESS FOR SMALL AND RURAL CARRIERS AND OTHER PROSPECTIVE 
USERS.  
Requiring prospective spectrum  users to undertake the lengthy process under the current 
secondary markets rules is inefficient and contravenes the Commissio n’s goals of enabling rapid spectrum 
access for users of all types.  To reduce these inefficiencies and better incent licensees to enter into

"3 secondary market transactions with parties requiring spectrum access, including small and rural carriers, 
the Comm ission should take advantage of the capabilities of database- enabled approaches to automat e 
and streamlin e many of the processes that introduce friction into today’s secondary market for spectrum 
use.  By leverag ing the capabilities of these technologies t o automate such transactions, the Commission 
can facilitate a more robust secondary market for spectrum  use rights for all users as 5G, and the myriad, 
bandwidth- intensive applications it will enable, nears .   
A. A Voluntary, Database -Enabled Approach to Stre amlining Secondary 
Market Transactions Would Generate Benefits for Both Licensees and 
Prospective Users and Incent Greater Use of The Commission’s Secondary 
Market Mechanisms.  
Specifically, the Commission should authorize the establishment of one or more d atabases into 
which licensees could, on a voluntary basis, confidentially enter information regarding its existing 
deployments and the circumstances and terms  (including, for example, protection criteria to be 
implemented between the licensee’s operations and those of any prospective user ) under which the 
licensee would agree to enter into a secondary market transaction.  The administrator of the database 
could then calculate what spectrum is available in what locations, and publish aggregated, anonymized 
and obfuscated spectrum availability information that would not reveal any radio-  or licensee -specific 
data while enabling prospective users to assess spectrum availability in their area.  Such aggregated, 
anonymized and obfuscated data would provide prospe ctive users general  information about spectrum use  
while withholding potentially commercially sensitive or security -related, licensee- specific information , 
and thus would serve to balance the needs of licensees and prospective users.  The database administ rator  
would only be permitted to publish, for instance, a graphical mosaic or heat map —based on certain 
aggregated, an onymized or obfuscated licensee deployment  information —showing the level of spectrum 
use in a given area and the amount of spectrum available (or in use) .  Such information would not reveal  
the licensee identity, specific location of any radio , or the specific frequencies in use, and a prospective 
counterparty would not obtain such details until it entered negotiations with the licensee  (subject to a 
nondisclosure agreement if required by the licensee) .  This approach would address  potential security and 
commercial concerns about the publication of such aggregated and anonymized data, as the licensee,",2,Federated Wireless Comments on Partitioning and Disaggregation NPRM - FINAL 6.3.2019.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"4 location, and operational informati on for any given deployment  would be withheld from public 
disclosure, while permitting current and prospective users to better plan for future deployments.   
Such an approach was recently implemented for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service3 and 
would reduce burdens for both prospective users and licensees, and thus should be applied more broadly 
to close the information gap between prospective users and licensees and facilitate more widespread, 
dense spectrum use.  For prospective users, the existence of such a database would significantly 
streamline the process of identifying where suitable spectrum to support their needs is available.  For 
licensees, voluntarily making such information available  would similarly simplify the process of 
identifying counterparties whose needs match the licensee’s current and future plans for use of its 
spectrum.   
Moreover, by enabling licensees to upload the terms and conditions on which spectrum access 
would be made available, such a voluntary database would permit prospect ive users to review and 
instantaneously agree to those terms on a click -through basis.  In so doing, this approach could 
significantly shorten the timelines and reduce the administrative costs of negotiating secondary market 
agreements.  As a result, prosp ective users would be able to obtain the spectrum access they need in a 
much more expeditious and straightforward manner than they do today, enabling them to focus their 
resources on putting the spectrum to productive use at the earliest possible opportuni ty.  This approach 
would also provide licensees with an effective tool for use by their sales organizations, allowing them to 
quickly and efficiently execute and implement commercial agreements that generate revenue for the 
business.  This is particularly so in those geographic areas where full -scale deployments have presented a 
challenging business proposition for the licensee but where a prospective user has a need that can be met 
by the licensee’s spectrum holdings.   
Most importantly, by effectively aut omating the process of identifying counterparties and 
negotiating an appropriate agreement, the use of such a voluntary database would dramatically reduce the 
                                                      
3 See Promoting Investment in the 3550- 3700 MHz Band, GN Docket No. 17 -258, Report and Order, FCC 18- 149, at 
paras. 112- 23 (2018).",3,Federated Wireless Comments on Partitioning and Disaggregation NPRM - FINAL 6.3.2019.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"5 transaction costs associated with these steps today.  In this way, a voluntary, database -enabled approach 
would help licensees monetize their unused or little -used spectrum, and do so with little corresponding 
cost.  As described above, the licensee could determine upfront the protection criteria required to 
implement secondary market transactions in its license areas.  Once it has made this determination and 
uploaded its requirements into the database, the licensee would not have to conduct its own interference 
analyses for each prospective transaction.  Instead, the database administrator would condu ct the 
necessary analyses to determine whether a prospective user’s desired operations would comply with the 
licensee -specific protection criteria and, if it did not, would not present the prospective user with the 
option to initiate negotiations with the licensee.  Similarly , by housing the terms and conditions on which 
a licensee would make spectrum available in the secondary market , which the licensee could customize to 
best fit its operations in particular areas and/or spectrum bands,  and automating the  negotiation process, 
this approach would relieve licensees of the need to devote legal and operational resources to each and 
every transaction as a one- off matter.   
This voluntary, database -enabled approach would allow the licensee to provide its operati onal 
and financial requirements upfront and thereafter avoid ongoing management of the secondary market 
transaction negotiation and implementation process , instead only updating its requirements as necessary,  
thus providing a significant amount of cost avoidance.  In reducing the costs associated with engaging in a 
secondary market transaction in this way, as well as more readily identifying potential counterparties, the 
use of such a voluntary database would fundamentally alter the cost -benefit analysis that licensees must 
conduct  and thereby increase the likelihood that such an analysis would result in the execution of a 
commercial agreement between the licensee and the prospective user.  This is particularly  crucial as 5G 
roll-out approaches.  5G will enable a wide variety of new use cases, many of which will require robust 
throughput and capacity, and as a result 5G deployments will be conducted by many more non- traditional 
users than was the case in the transition from 3G to 4G.  By facilitating streamlined secondary markets 
transactions, a voluntary , database- enabled approach would allow licensees to efficiently execute 
commercial agreements to provide such non -traditional users with the spectrum access they need, and 
thus aid in expediting the roll -out of 5G services.",4,Federated Wireless Comments on Partitioning and Disaggregation NPRM - FINAL 6.3.2019.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"6 B. A Voluntary, Database -Enabled Approach Would Facilitate Streamlined, 
Robust Commission Oversight of Spectrum Use.  
In addition to incenting increased secondary market transactions between licen sees and 
prospective spectrum users, a voluntary, database- enabled approach to such transactions could also aid 
the Commission in performing its spectrum management, licensing, and oversight functions.  For 
example, to facilitate a given transaction, the d atabase would have to obtain certain information that the 
Commission would likewise require for purposes of its oversight of the use of commercial spectrum:  
licensee and counterparty identities and information, licensed service of the spectrum at issue, g eographic 
area covered by the transaction, amount of spectrum covered by the transaction, term of the agreement 
(for leases), etc.  The database could similarly gather additional information required by the Commission, 
such as any required certifications as to the prospective user’s qualifications for holding a license, 
including those related to foreign ownership, character and other requirements .4  By interfacing with the 
Commission’s licensing databases, such as the Universal Licensing System, the volunt ary secondary 
markets database could provide the Commission information on a transaction and the parties thereto that 
would allow the Commission to perform its oversight functions with respect to such a transaction on an 
expedited basis.  Moreover, the vol untary secondary markets database could provide any ongoing 
reporting functions needed to ensure the Commission’s records remain accurate, for example, as a 
secondary market agreement is terminated, extended, or modified in terms of the covered geography o r 
spectrum. 
In addition, by reducing the transaction costs associated with the current processes required to 
negotiate and implement a secondary market transaction, the use of a voluntary secondary markets 
database would enhance the effectiveness of regulatory incentives already enacted by the Commission.  
For example, the Commission’s spectrum leasing rules provide that a licensee may rely on its lessee’s 
buildout to satisfy any performance requirements  applicable to the licensee.5  As noted above, however , a 
                                                      
4 See, e.g. , 47 C.F.R. § 1.9046 (providing for the collection of such pre -certifications to streamline spectrum 
manager leases in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service).  
5 See id. §§ 1.9020(d)(5), 1.9030(d)(5) .",5,Federated Wireless Comments on Partitioning and Disaggregation NPRM - FINAL 6.3.2019.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"7 licensee must weigh the expected benefits of a given secondary market transaction against its expected 
costs, including those associated with negotiating and implementing it.  Given the high transaction costs 
present in today’s secondary market, the value of these benefits —including the ability to rely on a 
counterparty’s activities to satisfy regulatory requirements —is effectively discounted.  By reducing the 
expected costs of a given transaction, the use of a voluntary secondary markets database would  eliminate 
this discount against the value of a transaction’s benefits, giv ing existing regulatory incentives , such as 
the ability to rely on a lessee’s buildout , the value the Commission expected when it adopted these rules.  
III. CONCLUSION.  
Federated Wireless  applauds the Commission for its continued efforts to assure spectrum access 
for all users and encourages the Commission to examine every available tool at its disposal to accomplish 
these ends, particularly as 5G and its increased demands on our spectrum resources loom.  For the 
foregoing reasons, the Commission should explore the use of a voluntary, database -enabled approach, 
which would:  (1) significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with the negotiation and 
implementation of secondary markets  agreements, thereby facilitating greater use of the Commission’s 
secondary markets mechanisms;  and (2) streamline the Commission’s performance of its spectrum 
management, licensing, and oversight obligations.  Federated Wireless stands ready to assist the  
Commission as it seeks to identify innovative ways to maximize spectrum access to support next -
generation services and ensure ongoing U.S. leadership in the global wireless marketplace.

COMMENTS OF  
THE NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION 
The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (“NRECA”) hereby submits its 
Comments in response to the Commission’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking exploring potential 
changes to its partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules to increase spectrum access by small 
and rural carriers.1  NRECA appreciates the Commission’s focus on the availability of advanced 
telecommunications capabilities in rural areas and believes that certain changes to the 
Commission’s rules will promote rural services deployment as explained herein. 
I. BACKGROUND 
NRECA is the national service organization for more than 900 not-for-profit rural electric 
cooperatives that provide electric energy to approximately 42 million people in 47 states --  
approximately 12 percent of all U.S. electric customers.  Rural electric cooperatives serve 88% of 
U.S. counties, including 327 of the Nation's 353 ""persistent poverty counties. 
Rural electric cooperatives were formed to provide safe, reliable electric service to their 
member-owners at the lowest reasonable cost.  Rural electric cooperatives are dedicated to 
improving the communities in which they serve; management and staff of rural electric

"2 cooperatives are active in rural economic development efforts.  Electric cooperatives are private, 
not-for-profit entities that are owned and governed by the members to whom they deliver 
electricity.  Electric cooperatives are democratically governed and operate according to the seven 
Cooperative Principles.2
NRECA and its members are intensely interested in the deployment of advanced 
telecommunications capabilities within the rural communities and areas in which electric 
cooperatives provide electric service.3  In many of our members’ communities, incumbent 
service providers do not offer fixed broadband service that meets the current fixed broadband 
benchmark of 25 Mbps download/3 Mbps upload (25/3 Mbps), prompting many electric 
cooperatives to undertake the investments and commit the resources to deploy fixed broadband 
services within these communities.  Over 100 NRECA members provide fixed broadband service 
today, deploying fiber-based, fixed wireless or combination fiber and fixed wireless networks.  
Forty-two rural electric cooperatives participated in the Commission’s recent Connect America 
Phase II auction (“CAF II Auction”),4 securing over $254,000,000 in support over ten years.5
In addition to deploying wireless communications networks to serve their members, 
electric cooperatives make use of a wide variety of wireless communications services to meet 
the private, internal requirements of operating the electric grid.  NRECA member companies are 
authorized by the Commission to operate facilities in the Part 90 Private Land Mobile Radio 
(“PLMR”) service, Part 101 Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service (“POFS”), and Part 
2 The seven Cooperative Principles are: Voluntary and Open Membership, Democratic Member Control, Members’ 
Economic Participation, Autonomy and Independence, Education, Training and Information, Cooperation Among 
Cooperatives, and Concern for Community.

"3 27 Wireless Communications Service, among others.  NRECA’s members have increasingly 
sought to acquire auctioned spectrum, particularly through the secondary market.  This spectrum 
is used for supervisory control and data acquisition systems (“SCADA”) to remotely monitor 
and control substation and field devices, teleprotection to guard against potentially hazardous 
faults, distribution automation to intelligently route power through the grid, metering, mobile 
radio, video, security, and other applications.  Wireless communications are critical to the safe, 
reliable, and effective electric services NRECA’s members provide to rural America. 
II. COMMENTS 
NRECA supports the Commission’s efforts “to facilitate the deployment of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas.”6  Countless communities served by electric 
cooperatives remain on the unserved/underserved side of the digital divide.  The deployment of 
wireless broadband service in rural communities would increase incomes, improve education, and 
provide better access to healthcare services. The absence of robust fixed broadband services in 
rural communities imposes a high economic cost on rural communities.  A recent nationwide 
study performed by NRECA staff concluded that the lack of fixed broadband in 6.3 million 
electric co-op households translates to more than $68 billion in lost economic value measured 
over 20 years.7  These findings were echoed in a 2018 Purdue University study of the rural 
communities served by seven electric cooperatives in the State of Indiana.8  The report calculates 
an aggregate benefit of $12.0 billion measured over twenty-years from broadband deployment in 
6 NPRM at 6.

"4 these communities.  These benefits are attributed to expanded telemedicine and education 
opportunities, consumer savings; increased farm income; general economic development; and 
increased state sales and income tax revenues.  Taken as a whole, these benefits provide a 4:1 
return on broadband infrastructure investment.9  This data strongly supports the development of 
rules to promote deployment of advanced telecommunications in rural areas.  Such rules will also 
support the Commission’s statutory objectives to disseminate licenses among a wide variety of 
applicants, ensure that rural companies have an opportunity to participate in the provision of 
spectrum-based services, and promote the availability of innovative services to rural America.10
NRECA makes the following recommendations: 
A.Primary Markets 
As a threshold matter, although the Commission is focused on the secondary markets of 
partitioning, disaggregation and leasing, NRECA suggests that two changes to the manner in 
which spectrum is assigned through the primary market -- spectrum auctions – could have a 
greater impact on promoting rural services. 
Auction Bidding Credits  - In the recent auction of 600 MHz Band licenses, the 
Commission offered, for the first time, a rural service provider (“RSP”) bidding credit to counter 
the fact that rural service providers have often faced “challenges in their efforts to obtain 
financing because the rural areas they seek to serve are not as profitable as more densely-
populated markets.”11 The RSP bidding credit provides a 15 percent bidding credit to eligible 
entities that predominantly serve rural areas and have fewer than 250,000 combined wireless,

"5 wireline, broadband and cable subscribers.12  Based on its experience with the 600 MHz auction, 
the Commission also adopted the RSP for the upcoming auction of Citizens Broadband Radio 
Service Priority Access Licenses.  NRECA strongly supports the continued use of the RSP to 
encourage auction participation for rural markets. 
Likewise, NRECA supports the continued use of the Commission’s standardized Part I 
small business bidding credits.13  This program provides tiered bidding credits for entities with 
average gross revenues not exceeding $55 million over the preceding three years.  Like the RSP, 
these bidding credits help ensure a diverse group of entities have the ability to participate in the 
Commission’s auction process.    
Auction License Sizes  - NRECA strongly believes that larger geographic areas for 
auctioned licenses such as MEAs and PEAs result in lower levels of service in rural areas.  This 
is reflected in the results of deployment under many current spectrum bands.  Licensees of 
larger geographic areas focus deployment in the more densely-populated centers of such areas, 
leaving less densely-populated areas underserved.  Offering licenses by large geographic areas 
risks a result in which large swaths of rural America are licensed, but not served, by carriers 
looking to provide service in urban cores.  In addition, rural entities will be at a disadvantage in 
trying to compete at auction when they only seek to purchase less populated areas that are 
included in larger licenses.  NRECA is encouraged that the FCC has recently explored smaller 
license sizes, such as counties and census tracts, for auctioned licenses.  NRECA encourages the 
Commission to adopt similar smaller license sizes in future auctions.

"6 B.Secondary Markets 
With respect to the secondary markets, NRECA supports efforts to encourage licensees to 
partition, disaggregate, and/or lease spectrum to rural providers.  NRECA believes that adjusted 
performance requirements could be used to incentivize licensees to sell or lease unused spectrum 
to smaller, rural providers.  For the incentives to be effective, the benefit should be applied to the 
partitioning/disaggregating licensee.  For example, an entity seeking an extension of its 
construction deadline could receive a presumption that grant of the extension is in the public 
interest if the licensee partitions or disaggregates a certain percentage of rural spectrum from its 
licenses.  Similarly, the Commission could consider partition or disaggregation of rural spectrum 
as a factor towards supporting a determination that a licensee has met performance requirements.  
NRECA also recommends the FCC formally codify its rural safe harbors for substantial 
service into its rules and make certain clarifications to those safe harbors.  In 2004, the 
Commission adopted two safe harbors whereby licensees in all wireless services licensed on a 
geographic basis could meet performance requirements by demonstrating substantial service 
through coverage of a certain percentage of geography in a percentage of rural areas within a 
licensed area.14 Specifically, for mobile wireless services a licensee may demonstrate it has met 
its performance requirements by providing coverage to, “at least 75 percent of the geographic 
area of at least 20 percent of the rural areas within the licensed area.”15  For fixed services 
licensees must demonstrate deployment of permanent fixed end points in at least 20% of the 
rural counties in a licensee’s authorized area.16  Although these safe harbors exist in Commission

Telephone Companies To Provide Spectrum-Based Services et al., WT Docket No. 02-382 et al., Report and Order

"7 precedent they were never added to the rules, which causes some confusion among prospective 
partitionees/disaggregatees regarding their applicability to any particular service.  Further, the 
Commission should clarify the use of “area” in the rural safe harbors.  In practice, the 
Commission has interpreted “area” to be synonymous with “county”.  However, license partitions 
often include partial counties and it is unclear how these are considered under the rural safe 
harbors.  Excluding de minimis  portions of partial counties from the rural safe harbor calculation 
would encourage rural licensees to acquire partitioned spectrum.  
NRECA shares the Commission’s concern that while reduced buildout requirements may 
increase the number of licensees willing to lease, partition, or disaggregate spectrum, it may also 
decrease deployment of advanced wireless services in rural areas if the reduced performance 
requirements are applied to the receiving, rural licensee.  Likewise allowing reaggregation of 
spectrum into a larger license may disincentivize rural deployment in some instances.  For that 
reason, NRECA does not support a blanket relaxation or extension of performance requirements 
for rural areas. However, NRECA recommends the Commission consider the rural nature of a 
licensed area as a factor in determining whether performance requirements have been met or 
whether to grant an extension of performance requirements when a licensee has made good faith 
efforts to cover rural areas.  For example, rural cooperatives may cover a large geographic area, 
but a relatively low population.  Such licensees should not be penalized for deployments that do 
not meet population coverage thresholds more applicable to urban areas.   
C. Private Internal Users  - The MOBILE NOW Act directs the Commission to 
focus on spectrum availability for “covered small carriers,” which encompasses only common 
carriers.  The Commission should also apply any rule revisions to the use of spectrum to provide 
advanced telecommunications on a non-common carrier basis and for use of spectrum for",6,NRECA Rural Spectrum Partition Comments final 6 3 2019.pdf,THE NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"8 private, internal purposes.  As explained above, NRECA’s electric cooperative members rely on 
communications technologies to support their provision of electric service to rural Americans.  
Applications and devices are continuously evolving to enhance the safety, reliability, and 
efficiency of the electric grid.  This is commonly referred to as the “Smart Grid” and includes 
advancements in metering, sensing, and grid management that benefit the public.  These 
capabilities are provided through a combination of wired (typically fiber) and wireless 
communications.  Although NRECA’s members do use carrier-based services, private, internally 
provided communications are required for certain mission critical applications.  The use of 
private, internal communications provides the ability to control reliability and restoration, which 
are critical to electric utilities.  In addition, commercial carrier services often do not adequately 
cover the rural and remote areas served by electric coops or are intended to cover population 
centers and not utility infrastructure such as substations and transmission and distribution lines.  
The Commission should include private, internal services in any rule revisions to promote the 
availability of spectrum in rural areas for advanced telecommunications.",7,NRECA Rural Spectrum Partition Comments final 6 3 2019.pdf,THE NATIONAL RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"9 III. CONCLUSION 
There are tangible social, educational and economic benefits to promoting advanced 
telecommunications services in rural America.  NRECA supports that the Commission continues 
to make meaningful strides in supporting rural deployments.  NRECA believes that further 
incentivizing rural spectrum deployment, both for common carrier as well as private, internal 
services, should be explored.  NRECA looks forward to working further with the Commission on 
this matter.

Washington, D.C. 20554
COMMENTS OF THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION, INC.
The Rural Wireless Association, Inc. (“RWA”) files these comments in response to the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ NPRM ”) adopted by the Federal Communications 
Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) seeking comment on “specific questions related to the 
partitioning or disaggregation of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to 
increase availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access 
by small carriers.”1  RWA believes that many of the new rules proposed by the Commission are 
unnecessary, will lead to unintended consequences that actually hurt small carriers and rural 
communities, and do nothing but mask inherent flaws in how commercial spectrum is auctioned 
by the Commission for the intended ultimate benefit of American consumers.

"2 I. BACKGROUND 
The Commission’s NPRM  is the direct result of the MOBILE NOW Act, 2 a recent law 
which compels the Commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to “assess whether to 
establish a program, or modify existing programs, under which a licensee that receives a license 
for the exclusive use of spectrum…may partition or disaggregate the license by sale or long-term 
lease.”3  Congress did not mandate new Commission rules that allow for reduced performance 
requirements for partitioned or disaggregated licenses, but merely asked the Commission to 
“assess” the situation.4      Congress also stipulated that the purpose of partitioning or 
disaggregation under any new or modified Commission program is: 
(A)  []to - 
(i) provide services consistent with the license; and 
(ii) make unused spectrum available to – 
(I) an unaffiliated covered small carrier; or 
(II) an unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area; and 
(B)if the Commission finds that such a program would promote – 
(i) the availability of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas; or 
(ii) spectrum availability for covered small carriers. 
I. REGARDLESS OF THE MOBILE NOW ACT’S FOCUS ON PARTITIONING 
AND DISAGREGGATION, THE COMMISSION SHOULD ADDRESS 
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN ITS RULES REGARDING LICENSE SERVICE 
RULES AND AUCTION PROCEDURES.  
To the extent that Congress saw a need to improve this country’s laws governing FCC 
license ownership and leasing to increase coverage in rural markets and put fallow spectrum in 
the hands of small carriers, Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act failed to address the real 
issue.  When it comes to maximizing the utility and potential of fallow spectrum, the real

"3 problem today in the wireless industry (and the problem that the MOBILE NOW Act should 
have addressed) relates to the Commission’s existing service rules and auction procedures.  The 
Commission’s rules today have inherent flaws - - flaws that Congress is attempting to fix years 
after the spectrum is auctioned and made available to American consumers.  First, the 
Commission’s rules on spectrum aggregation effectively permit the country’s largest carriers to 
hoard wireless licenses (whether at auction, or in subsequent secondary market transactions) and 
be subject to what amounts to only a soft spectrum cap.  In addition, the Commission’s service 
rules, especially for recently-auctioned mid-band and high-band spectrum, create license sizes 
that are too large for the types of spectrum they cover5, and the interim and end-of-term 
performance ( i.e., “build-out”) requirements associated with those large-sized licenses are too 
vague to ensure timely construction and too long to ensure that auctioned areas receive service in 
a timely manner.   
If Congress truly wanted to reduce vast amounts of fallow commercial wireless 
spectrum and encourage the build-out of even basic wireless coverage in rural markets, it should 
have mandated that the Commission:  (1) re-institute a spectrum cap and not just maintain a soft 
spectrum screen; (2) auction commercial wireless licenses using geographic license sizes that 
correspond naturally to the frequency of the spectrum band ( i.e., the higher the frequency, the 
smaller the license size); and (3) adopt build-out/performance requirements that are realistic and 
5 Higher frequency radio waves propagate shorter distances.  Accordingly, if the geographic 
license area for a high-frequency spectrum band is very large, this means it would require the 
licensee to deploy a greater number of radio-access network sites to cover the license area than it 
would require for a low-frequency license band, which requires much fewer radio-access 
network sites. The largest size license area regardless of the spectrum frequency band being 
auctioned should be Cellular Market Areas (CMAs).  CMAs have worked perfectly to divide up 
urban and rural areas since CMAs are made up of both Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) 
and Rural Service Areas (RSAs).  CMAs have been used by the Commission in numerous low-
band and mid-band licensing regimes since the 1980s, including in the following bands:  850 
MHz/Cellular, AWS-1, AWS-3, and 700 MHz.",2,RWA Spectrum Policies Comments - FINAL.pdf,THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"4 do not incent licensees to sit on spectrum for years, and then use leases, partitioning, and 
disaggregation as a back-door to receiving a waiver to avoid surrendering fallow spectrum.  To 
the extent the Commission already retains delegated authority to improve these spectrum 
licensing and auction processes, it should do so.  There is a problem with commercial spectrum 
withering away on the sidelines after FCC auctions,6 but the solution is not reduced performance 
requirements, including build-out extensions that can last a year or longer under a new licensee 
or lessee.  Rather, the solution is to limit the amount of spectrum that goes into the “warehouses” 
of the country’s largest carriers and spectrum speculators, while simultaneously making it easier 
for small, rural carriers to successfully bid on spectrum at auction without the need to wait years 
to lease or purchase this very same spectrum at a premium with money that goes into the pockets 
not of the American taxpayer, but of individuals and corporations who simply chose to sit on it 
for decades.  
II. REDUCED PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTITIONED OR 
DISAGGREGATED LICENSES WILL NOT FACILITATE DEPLOYMENT 
OF ADVANCED WIRELESS SERVICES IN RURAL MARKETS.  
Extending built-out deadlines, whether interim or end-of-term, for licensees will not 
benefit consumers of wireless services in rural markets.  Nor will it increase access to spectrum 
by small carriers.  Instead, such a proposed policy will only encourage the country’s largest 
carriers to warehouse spectrum for years after acquisition.  When a licensee takes advantage of 
any type of reduced performance requirements (whether for spectrum partitioning, 
disaggregation, or leasing), it means that the licensee is having difficulty fulfilling the build-
out/performance requirements, in violation of the Commission’s well-publicized rules.  Relaxing 
the current rules to accommodate spectrum speculators, spectrum “warehousers”, and large 
6 See e.g., In the Matter of Bresnan Communications, LLC Request for Waiver , Public Notice, 
WT Docket No. 16-319, DA 16-1152 (released October 6, 2016).",3,RWA Spectrum Policies Comments - FINAL.pdf,THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"5 carriers whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs sends the wrong message.  Likewise, pairing 
reduced performance requirements with increased oversight and increased penalties for non-
performance does not ensure adequate build-out to rural areas.   
III. SPECTRUM REAGGREGATION SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED 
Allowing the reaggregation of spectrum creates the potential for abuse by large 
carriers.  Allowing reaggregation encourages licensees to use partitioning to avoid their buildout 
obligations by partitioning non-desirable or hard-to-serve spectrum and then re-aggregating that 
very same spectrum at a later date.  In short, allowing reaggregation will simply encourage 
spectrum warehousing.  Such a scenario is very likely now that the Commission has elected to 
use significantly larger Partial Economic Areas (PEAs) for the spectrum millimeter wave 
(mmW) spectrum in the 37, 39, and 47 GHz Bands instead of CMAs or even counties.7  Due to 
the difficulty of meeting performance requirements for these larger areas, licensees will be 
incented to partition and/or disaggregate rather than attempt to meet them.  If the Commission is 
entertaining the prospect of spectrum license “reaggregation,” then it must install safeguards that 
prevent the gaming of the system. Moreover, any type of reaggregation rule must comply with 
the Congressional mandate to promote the availability of spectrum in rural areas. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Congress’ intent in the MOBILE NOW Act is explicit:  “[t]he Commission may offer 
a licensee incentives or reduced performance requirements under this section only if the 
Commission finds that doing so would likely result in increased availability of advanced 
7 47 CFR § 30.104.  Some PEAs in rural America can be thousands of square miles in size.  The 
build-out or performance requirements for all Upper Microwave Flexible Use Service (UMFUS) 
licenses in these three high-frequency bands is either 40 percent of the population within the 
service area of the licensee, or 25 percent of the geographic area of the license.",4,RWA Spectrum Policies Comments - FINAL.pdf,THE RURAL WIRELESS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"6 telecommunications services in a rural area.”8 (emphasis added)  There is no evidence in support 
of such a finding.  There is no anecdotal evidence suggesting that a new framework with reduced 
performance requirements will work as envisioned by Congress.  Reduced performance 
requirements are not only unnecessary, they will lead to more spectrum warehousing.  Instead, 
more attention should be given to implementing a spectrum cap, right-sizing the original licenses 
prior to auction, and lowering the barriers to rural carriers participating in those auctions so they 
do not have to wait years and years to get spectrum scraps.

COMMENTS OF  
OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE  AT NEW AMERICA  
and PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE  
 
The Open Technology Institute at New America ( “OTI”) and Public Knowledge ( “PK”) 
submit these comments in response  to the Commission’s March 15, 2019 Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking seeking comment on questions “related to the partitioning or disaggregation of 
spectrum licenses and  spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase availability of advanced 
telecommunications services in rural areas and spectrum access by small carriers.”1 
I.  Introduction and Summary  
The Commission’s stated goal in this proceeding  is to promote  more widespread 
deployments of high -capacity broadband in rural and other underserved areas by enhancing the 
incentives and procedures for  secondary market access to unused spectrum licensed for exclusive 
use. Enabling m ore intense and efficient use of this public resource  – rather than non -use and 
warehousing – without risk of harmful interference and without undermining the deployment 
plans of primary licensees is a goal that OTI and PK fully support .

changes that focus  on relaxing performance requirements for licensees – will result in an 
outcome contrary to Congressional intent , with even more spectrum lying fallow for longer 
periods and an even more daunting digital divide widening between urban and rural areas. 
History shows that larger carriers choose  not to engage in secondary market transactions with 
smaller providers and choose to let spectrum lie fallow rather than partition or lease parts of their 
spectrum licenses.  The national and regional mobile carriers that can afford to acquire expensive 
license s covering very large areas (whether PEAs, CMAs or counties) have  little or  no incentive 
to participate in partitioning and leasing of spectrum to smaller competitive carriers.  In addition 
to their understandable ave rsion to enabling potential competition, secondary market transactions 
today are also deterred by  high transaction costs , cumbersome procedures,  and a preference by  
licensee s not to give up spectrum they may decide they want later for their own  deployments .  
Accordingly, OTI and PK recommend that  the Commission adopt broader  “use-it-or-
share -it” rules as p art of any e ffort to enco urage secondary market  access  and more intensive use 
of spectrum for broadband .  Conceptually, use -it-or-share -it rules authorize opportunistic access 
to licensed spectrum that is unused or underutilized in a specific area. Use-it-or-share -it rules 
would make sure there are limits on the ability of licensees to warehouse  spectrum or ex clude 
potential rural ISPs able to make use of that spectrum to help bridge the digital divide. A general 
authorization for opportunistic  access on a use -it-or-share -it basis sh ould be  a central part of any 
effort aimed at expanding spectrum access for rural and non -traditional ISPs, as well as for 
enterprise and institutional use, in rural and underserved areas.  
Use-it-or-share -it rules have been adopted by the Commission in relation to two 
significant flexible -use bands in recent years: the Citizens Broa dband Radio Service (CBRS)",3,WiFu+PK_Secondary Markets Comments_FINAL_AsFiled_060319.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE  AT NEW AMERICA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 band at  3.5 GHz and continued unlicensed use of unused spectrum in the 600 MHz band  
following the TV inc entive auction .  Automated frequency coordination (AFC) systems, such as 
the one the Commission will soon prove is workable for controlling temporary  and opportunistic 
access to locally -unused spectrum  in the  Priority Access License (PAL) portion of the CBRS 
band , can ensure that unused spectrum can be  put to use in rural and other hard -to-serve area s 
without any risk of interference or any negative impact whatsoever on the primary licensee that 
has not yet built out.  
Opportunistic access controlled  by an automated AFC database would  empower a wide 
variety of small and alternative  providers to use fallow spectru m in local areas  to provide high -
speed broadban d and other services, while  retaining the licensee’s right to exclusive use of  that 
spectrum whenever the carrier commences service with  its own operations in the licensed band. 
Unleashing opportunistic, share d access to fall ow spectrum creates a general incentive for 
licensees to build out services more quickly, or to make greater efforts to partition or lease, since 
opportunistic use of the band will demonstrate that other (typically smaller) operators are fi nding 
value in the unused portions of their license area.  This will reduce spectrum warehousing and 
increase access to operators that are ready to deploy, but who lack spectrum access in a local 
area.  Automated frequency coordination brings additi onal benefits  that directly encourage 
partition and leasing , including demand  discovery  and lower transaction  costs . Database 
coordination can also, for the first time, give the FCC itself visibility into what areas are 
receiving service or no t on a licensed band throughout the license term.  
Use-it-or-share -it rules are crucial to stimulating  a robust secondary market that will help 
bridge the digital divide, particularly in rural areas. Even temporary relief for consumers in these 
areas would go a long way to helping bridge the rural -urban digital divide.",4,WiFu+PK_Secondary Markets Comments_FINAL_AsFiled_060319.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE  AT NEW AMERICA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 II.  Incentives and Opportunities Limited to Partitioning and Leasing are Ina dequate  
 
Relying solely on licensees and market forces to transfer unused spectrum to other users, 
particularly smaller and potentially competitive ISPs, through partitioni ng and leasing has proven 
there is  a market failure.  Since the very first auctions in 1994, a policy to facilitate nationwide 
coverage has led to  license areas that are extremely large and typically incorporate areas with 
disparate  characteristics (urban, suburban , exurban  and rural) over geographies far la rger than are 
practical for small  ISPs or for enterprise and institutional users (e.g., corporate and university 
campuses, ports, etc.) . As the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association (WISPA ) argued 
in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) pr oceeding, “historically, large carriers acquire 
licenses for large areas, build out in the urban core where the population is more dense, and 
warehouse spectrum in rural areas that could be used for broadband deployment.”2 The largest 
carriers have a histo ry of warehousing spectrum and leaving it fallow  rather than  making it 
available for use to catalyze broadband deployment or other services.3 For licensees, there are no 
obvious incentives to share or partition their spectrum absent specific rules such as use-or-share.  
Precedent suggests that secondary markets for partitioning and leasing  rarely  result in 
smaller providers being able to access fallow spectrum. According to a 2017 survey of WISPA 
members, 25 percent of respondents said that they had made efforts to obtain licensed spectrum 
from AT &T, Verizon, Sprint or T -Mobile – and that less than 10  percent of the WISPs  who tried 
to obtain spectrum  successfully did so.4 The Commission’s licensing records corr oborates

 WISPA’s information, showing  that ca rriers that generally obtain large -area licenses at auctions 
rarely interact in secondary market transactions with smaller competitive providers.5  
Further, secondary market transactions are subject to high transaction costs. The 
Commission acknowledge s this shortcoming i n its original 2015 CBRS O rder: “Traditional 
licensing areas will not allow users of the band to acquire PALs only for those specific 
geographic areas they intend to serve. Divesting large, unwanted swaths thr ough secondary 
markets transactions could impose significant transactions costs.”6  
Other reasons that secondary market transactions have not put nearly enough unused 
spectrum to work in rural and underserved areas include the difficulty potential buyers face in  
finding information about available spectrum  where they need it .  There is no database of 
available spectrum by geographic area. In fact, the Commission itself has no idea what portions 
of a license area are built out and serving customers . Since performance requirements are 
expressed in terms of  a share of the license area ’s overall population, milestones are satisfied by 
serving mainly cities and suburbs – and the FCC could still not know how much licensed 
spectrum remains fallow in a particular small town or rural area.   
 Another obstacle exacerbated by the opaque and one -off nature of secondary market 
transactions are the administrative process and the  complex and costly negotiations for secondary 
rights.7 Transaction costs fall d isproportionately on smaller  and rural operators  who then have to 
“incur spectrum leasing costs that are likely to be higher for them than for a large national

 operator who is likely already to have an in -house team to manage spectrum transactions,” 
according to economist Will iam Lehr.8 With the advent of geolocation databases and blockchain, 
transparency could be enhanced and transaction costs for all parties minimized if the overall 
framework for secondary access is tied coordination by an AFC database that would also fully 
protect the use rights (and not the warehousing rights) of licensees.  
The above -detailed shortcomings of secondary mar kets result in harms to smaller and  
rural providers  in particular , since large carriers inherently have few incentives to negotiate 
small, one -off partitions or leases that reduce their own flexibility. If a larger carrier commits to a 
partition or lease, it red uces that carrier’s optionality to deploy in that area  later when 
circumstances change. In contrast , under a  use-or-share  framework , a carrier would be able to 
allow opportunistic access to fallow spectrum with the ability to recall that spectrum for its own 
operations whenever it likes. Indeed, during the early years of a license a carrier may be entirely 
focused on building out in areas with the highest ARPU, and that carrier may not have decided 
when the spectrum will be put to use in rural and other less profitable areas —if the carrier ever 
does intend on doing so.  
There are large swaths of spectrum across low -, mid -, and high -bands tha t remain unused 
in low -density or low -ARPU areas even after licensees satisfy population -based performance 
requirements. The Commission should seek to allow other providers to use that spectrum on an 
opportunistic basis to bring high er-speed broadband serv ices to more Americans. The current  
partitioning and leasing framework has proven inadequate  to achieve this goal on its own.

 III.   A General Use -it-or-Share -it Rule Would Promote More Intensive Spectrum Use and 
Secondary Market Transactions in Rural and Other Underserved Areas  
 
 The Commission seeks comment on “whether to establish a program, or modify existing 
programs, for the partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing of licenses”9 and, more specifically, 
on the potential “incentives that might encourage  licensees to lease or sell spectrum to covered 
small carriers or unaffiliated carriers that will serve rural areas…”10 OTI and PK  urge the 
Commission to adopt use-it-or-share -it rules for all exclusively -licensed IMT bands to promote 
more intensive use of the spectrum, as well as stronger incentives and mechanisms to encourage 
secondary market transactions .  Only both approaches in tandem will result in more widespread 
availability of high -capacity broadband in  rural and other underserved areas of  the country.  
Use-it-or-share -it rules ensure licensees cannot warehouse  spectrum  indefinitely  or 
exclude  potential rural ISPs able to make use of that spectrum to help bri dge the digital divide. 
Automated frequency coordination (AFC) systems, such as the one th e Commission will soon 
prove is workable for controlling temporary and opportunistic access to the Priority Access 
License  (PAL)  portion of the CBRS band , can ensure that unused spectrum is put to use in rur al 
and other hard -to-serve areas without any risk  of interference or any negative impact whatsoever 
on the primary licensee that has not yet built out .  
A.  Use-it-or-Share -it Authorizations Should be Extended to All Flexible Use Bands  
 
Use-it-or-share -it rules have been adopted by the Commission in relation to two 
significant flexible -use bands in recent years and should be a central part of any effort aimed at 
expanding spectrum access for rural and non -traditional ISPs, as well as for enterprise and

 institutional use, in rural and underserved areas. Conceptually, use -it-or-share -it rules authorize 
opportunistic access to licensed spectrum that is unused or underutilized in a specific area. An 
authorization for opportunistic, shared use can (and should) gives licensees  a guarantee that 
opportunistic users will vacate  the spectrum once notified t hat the licensee is ready to commence 
service  in that local area and that it will never result in harmful interference to the primary 
licensee’s operation s.11  
The authorization of opportunistic access  takes a more affirmative, non -punitive 
approach than the more draconian concept of “use it or lose it,” where licensees would be forced 
to forfeit spectrum in areas that fall short of strict build -out requirements. Indeed, the 
Commi ssion could decide to permit licensees to attribute all or a portion of the areas served by 
opportunistic users to their own performance in relation to build -out requirements.  
Unleashing opportunistic, shared access to fall ow spectrum creates a general inc entive for 
licensees to build out services more quickly, or to make greater efforts to partition or lease, since 
opportunistic use of the band will demonstrate that other (typically smaller) operators are finding 
value in the unused portions of their licen se area. This will reduce spectrum warehousing and 
increase access to operators that are ready to deploy, but who lack spectrum access in a local 
area. All of these effects – and others described below – will advance the stated and statutory 
goal of this proceeding to stimulate secondary markets and, ultimately, ensure that rural and 
other underserved areas are more likely to receive coverage and higher -capacity broadband 
service  sooner rather than years and years later .12

  The Commission has recently set t wo important precedents for use -it-or-share -it rules 
that sugge st this  approach can prom ote spectrum access, efficiency and use in underserved areas 
more generally. The Commission, in adopting the new  Citizens Broadband Radio Service Rules 
(CBRS) for the 3.5 GHz ba nd, included a use-it-or-share rule, stating:  “We believe that the ‘use 
it or share it’ approach of our rules for this unique band also thus more reasonably 
accommodates the goals of Section 309(j) of the Act, including ‘to prevent stockpili ng or 
wareho using of spectrum.’”13 The use -it-or-share -it rules for CBRS authorize any operator to 
coordinate access to unused  PAL  spectrum on an opportunistic basis.  Permission to make  
General Authorized Access (GAA)  use of unused PAL spectrum in a local area must be granted 
by a certified Spectrum Access System that ensures the PAL spectrum is  not in use and will not 
interfere with  licensee  operatio ns. The SAS database thereby  facilitate s – on an automated basis 
at low cost – the spectrum sharing needed to ens ure that all the spectrum in the 3. 5 GHz band is 
available for use.  The application of the use -it-or-share -it rules in the CBRS context reflects 
precisely the goals the Commission seeks to achieve through this proceeding.   
In the record for the CBRS proceeding, many  commenters supported u se-it-or-share -it 
rules, including T -Mobile, WISPA, Google, the Wi -Fi Alliance, the Utilities Telecom Council, 
Shared Spectrum Company, Southern Company Services, Spectrum Bridge, and the White 
Spaces Alliance.14 The Commission retained the use -it-or-share -it rules when it changed the 
CBRS rules  last year, stating in the Report and Order  that “[t]argeted use cases are already 
encouraged by the “use -or-share” nature of the band and the GAA tier.”15 The Commission 
elaborated on the im portance of such rules, exp laining that  “Priority Access Licensees will be

 incentivized to sell on the secondary market spectrum within their license area that may lie 
outside of their current network build or that they otherwise do not need access to for their future 
deployments.”16 
More recently, the Commission adopted a use -it-or-share -it approach to unlicensed use of 
the 600 MHz band following the TV incentive auction .  The Commission authorized the 
continued operation of unlicensed on unused licensed spectrum  following the auction .  On a 
localized basis, the Commission authorized unlicensed TV White Space devices  to operate  
indefinitely in unused portions of the exclusively -licensed 600 MHz band until the licensee 
notifies  a certified TV Bands Database (TVDB) that it is  ready to com mence service in that 
specific area.  Since  TVWS users must renew their permission  to transmit every 24 hours, an 
opportunistic  automatically loses the ability to continue tran smit in that location.  
In adopting opportunistic access to unused 600 MHz spectrum post -auction, the 
Commission declar ed: “We will permit the continued operation of TVWS devices on repurposed 
spectrum except in those areas in which a 600 MHz  Band  licensee commences operations … 
Since TVWS devices can operate only on channels identified in the TV bands databases, these 
databases can serve to ensure that unlicensed operations will no longer occur on a channel on 
which a licensee has com menced service. When a 600 MHz Band licensee plans to commence 
operations on frequencies that include channels available for unlicensed operations under the 
rules for TVWS devices, that licensee can notify any of the TV bands database administrators 
when a nd where it plans to commence operations.”17 The implementation of this policy, a 
temporary use -it-or-share -it protocol, reflects how database administrators can facilitate this

 spectrum sharing between licensee s and other parties  who wish to share unused s pectrum in a 
local area .  
 As detailed in the examples above, a relatively static frequency coordination database can 
mana ge and automate the process. E xamples include TVDB s (already in operation), multiple 
SAS operators (about to go into operation), and t he Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) 
the Commission has proposed to manage unlicensed sharing in large portions of the 6 GHz  band . 
Even a simple, static database can  verify that a proposed deployment will not interfere with 
incumbent operations.  Further, terminating the grant when the incumbent gives notification it 
will be commencing service in a specific area does not require anything as complex as the 
dynamic SAS, the dynamic geolocation databa se required to protect mobile  U.S. Navy ships and 
other incumbents from interference. In its NPRM on opening the 6 GHz band for unlicensed  
services, the Commission  stated:  “We envision the AFC system to be a simple database that is 
easy to implement.”18 The Commission’s proposed  AFC in the 6 GHz band ca n be easily 
replicated in other bands to facilitate use -it-or-share -it rules.  
The United Kingdom’s spect rum regulator, Ofcom, has also addressed the ability of 
databases to facilitate spectrum sharing frameworks.  In a 2015 report, Ofcom observed that  
“[g]eolocation databases are making it easier for devices to identify spectrum that is available for 
sharing while protecting the operation of existing services. While the current focus is on the use 
of databases to manage access to TV white spaces within 470 -790 MHz, the fundamental 
principle is not frequency specific and can extended to a broader range of frequencies.”19 As 
noted in a recent report released by the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance, “The growing need to 
accommodate burgeoning demand, smaller cell size s, and more widespread deployments of local

 networks by a diverse range of users will push NRAs toward more sharing of underutilized 
bands. As this occurs, it becomes impractical for regulators to rely on manual coordination or to 
employ the staff necessar y to shoulder all of the functions listed above. Even if possible, it’s far 
faster and more cost -effective to rely on an automated system and focus agency resources on 
higher value -added activities.”20 
B.  Adding a General Use -or-Share Authorization Managed  by Automated Frequency 
Coordination Promotes Rural Coverage, Efficient Secondary Market Transactions and the 
Broader Public Interest  
 
 Rural, unserved, and other hard -to-serve areas have the greatest need for high -speed 
broadband  that can be facilitated by the repurposing of unused spectrum in those areas. The 
areas with more unused spectrum tend to be the regions where costs are highest relative to ARPU 
and small and rural ISPs cannot afford to buy exclusive, large -area licenses. Use -it-or-share -it 
rules , implemented in bands with equipment readily available, can empower aggregation with 
other bands to expand capacity and improve quality of service even if use is only temporary.  
Use-it-or-share -it creates  a general incentive for licensees to pursue secondary market 
transactions since it identifies operators who see value in using the band in a particular local

 area. This “ demand discovery ” puts market -based pressure on licensees to partition and/or lease. 
With use -it-or-share -it rules in place, licen sees will more readily identify small carriers as 
prospects for longer -term and more secure partitioning or leasing arrangements.  
On the buy side, opportunistic access creates a market for interference protection , serving 
as an intermediate step between  non-use and paying the licensee for partitioning and leasing 
spectrum. O pportunistic access can also serve as a form of price discovery. A small operator can 
do initial and test deployments to see if paying for interference protection would actually be 
worth the cost. Some small ISPs will determine that opportunistic use – temporary and without 
protection from interference – is all they can afford or justify, while others will ‘trade up’ to 
negotiate and purchase a partitioned license or leasehold as a mea ns of ensuring continued and 
exclusive use for a set period of years.  
These steps will benefit very small , rural , and other local operators  that do not have the 
funds to pay for (or do not need) interference protection, or where the transaction costs are 
simply too high to make it worthwhile for licen see. For example, a school or business may 
decide it could enhance the capacity of its network  by adding temporary, opportunistic use of 
locally-vacant spectrum .  Whether or not they ultimately come to an agreement to pay for 
exclusive use – through partitioning or leasing – the public benefits when unused spectrum, a 
resource that is infinitely renewable, is used to improve connectivity.   
Another potential incentive for licensees  that could be coupled with use -it-or-share -it 
deployments is described in the NPRM in relations to the  current rules for de facto  leases: 
“While the licensee/lessor remains responsible for compliance with any construction and 
performance requirements . . . the licensee/lessor may attribute to  itself the build -out or 
performance activities of its spectrum lessee(s) for purposes of compliance with any such",14,WiFu+PK_Secondary Markets Comments_FINAL_AsFiled_060319.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE  AT NEW AMERICA,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"15 
 requirements.”21  Essentially, licensees could receive credit s toward meeting  construction or 
performance requiremen ts without actually transferring  the spectrum. The FCC could decide to 
allow licensees to attribute all or a portion of the buildout and coverage by opportunistic users at 
the end of the licensing period to the licensee for purposes of renewal, a significant in centive to 
if it helps a licensee satisfy interim or final  performance requirements. In turn, another provider 
gains the opportunity to put that spectrum to use until the licensee is ready to commence service  
in that area. Licensees should be fully  protecte d from interference while retaining the “flexibility 
to determine the amount of spectrum they will occupy and the geographic area they will serve,” 
as the NPRM itself states.22  
 Automation and database c oordinat ion are central  to how use -it-or-share -it rules can 
stimulate high -speed broadband deployment in rural areas  while fully protecting the license 
rights of incumbents . When the Commission adopted its 1996 CMRS Partitioning and 
Disaggregation Order,23 the concept of automated frequency coordinatio n databases was more 
than a decade away. However, now that AFCs are both proven to be effective and available from 
a number of competing private sector providers, the Commission should seek to leverage the 
SAS and new special purpose databases to manage opportunistic sharing of unused capacity. OTI 
and PK were  among a coalition of public interest advocates and technology companies that 
detailed to the Commission how spectrum sharing, fueled  by database coordination, can make

 The uses of databases to facilitate use -it-or-share -it rules to promote high -speed

databases c an help ISPs find spectrum and facilitate secondary market transac tions such as 
leasing. For example, blockchain functionality can be incorporated into AFC  databases, as the 
recent report from the Dynamic Spectrum Alliance articulated: “Blockchain may have the 
potential to enhance frequency coordination and se condary market transactions, particularly in 
shared bands that will need (or benefit from) an AFC database.”25  In fact, the implementation of 
an online portal to notify ISPs, in the same manner of the current CBRS rules, would be far less 
burdensome than e ven the current “lightweight” notification that applies to spectrum manager 
leases in which the licensee retains de facto control.26

Commission’s March 15, 2019 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on questions 
“related to the partitioning or  disaggregation of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a 
potential means to increase availability of adva nced telecommunications services in rural areas 
and spectrum access by small carriers.”2 
 WISPA has a keen interest in promoting e fforts to make licensed spectrum available on 
in rural and unserved areas, appropriately sized  to allow smaller providers access to both the 
amount of spectrum and the coverage area require d to meet consumer demand.  To this end, 
WISPA generally supports the Commission’s objectiv es, and offers specific recommendations to 
provide incentives for partitioni ng, disaggregation and leasing in combination with consequences 
for licensees that do not deploy serv ice throughout their licensed areas. 
 
Introduction 
                                                            
1 WISPA represents more than 800 providers of fixe d wireless broadband service to millions of American 
consumers, largely in rural and underserved areas of the United States, using both unlicensed and licensed 
spectrum.  Almost all of its members are a “covered small carrier” as defined in the MOBILE NOW Act.  Pub. L. 115-141, Sec. 616, Mar. 23, 2018, 132 Stat. 1110 (codified as 47 U.S.C. § 1506) (not more than

In broadening the coverage foot print of wireless services in ru ral areas, it is critical that 
there be opportunities for providers to use bot h licensed and unlicensed spectrum to provide 
fixed broadband access.  In part due to the need to attract investment capital for network buildout 
into new areas, there is increasing interest among WISPs in gaining access to spectrum for 
exclusive use on a longer-term basis.  The great er certainty inherent  in having assigned 
bandwidth in a defined area is si gnificantly more attractive for out side investors who can provide 
financial support critical to accelerating service to the uns erved and underserved.  One key 
advantage of fixed wireless broadband is its substa ntially lower capital cost – about one-seventh 
the cost of fiber and one-fourth the cost of other wireline technologies.3 
Currently, rural broadband and other wireless  communications provi ders are suffering 
from a “double-whammy” of lenient build-out re strictions that enable  spectrum warehousing by 
license holders coupled with th e lack of effective incentives for large companies holding wide-
area spectrum licenses to make unus ed spectrum available to sma ller providers on the secondary 
market.  In a December 2017 survey of WISPA me mbers, fewer than ten percent of respondents 
reported that they had been successful in leas ing spectrum from the large mobile carriers.4  
Absent policies and effective rule s encouraging spectrum leasing, es pecially in ru ral areas, large 
companies may never launch service in less lucrative significant portions of their licensed markets.  In effect, licensed spectrum is in some  cases treated as a financial asset for market 
valuation purposes, but not as a resource for depl oying service to rural areas where the financial 
return may be many years in the future.  As a re sult, larger carriers serve the urban “holes” and

leave the rural “donuts” unser ved because of the lower popul ation density and corresponding 
higher per-customer deployment cost.  Because ru les do not appropriately encourage buildout to 
these areas, fallow spectrum is kept away from smaller service providers who would have both 
the incentive and the capability to depl oy in the remote and unserved “donuts.”  
The circumstances outlined above diverge mark edly from what would be expected under 
more modern spectrum access schemes, especia lly given this Commission’s commitment to 
solving the digital divide.5  A “keep what you use” approach ma y incentivize licensees with large 
spectrum portfolios, but as cu rrently implemented it may actually be counterproductive as 
standards based on population cove rage encourage licensees to satisfy the requirement for a 
large-footprint license by covering only the most  populated areas – the “d onut holes.”  In fact, 
some licensees may actually be more inclined to  return unserved rural areas to the Commission 
rather than retain such areas a nd be required to provide service there.  Likewise, a standalone 
“use it or share it” approach does make some  spectrum available opportunistically, but this 
provides only a basis for interim unlicensed use, a nd not more reliable exclusive licensed use for 
a definitive period.  Nonetheless,  in combination with other incen tives that both provide benefits 
and impose costs based on a lack of buildout, these tools can be part of an effective overall 
regulatory framework.  Promoting a more incen tive-based and active secondary market can 
enable more licensed spectrum use and quick er deployment, especially in rural areas.

Discussion 
 
I. THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHOR ITY TO ADOPT RULES TO 
PERMIT PARTITIONING, DISA GGREGATION AND LEASING TO 
PROMOTE BROADBAND ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS 
 
Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act provides that a ‘‘covered small carrier’’ permitted 
to obtain spectrum through secondary ma rket transactions is “a carrier … as defined in section 3 
of the Communications Act of 1934 ” that meets certain size parameters ( i.e., not more than 1,500 
employees) and provides services using its own facilities.6  In carrying out its public interest 
mandate, however, the Commission need not limit th e scope of its inquiry and its fashioning of 
new secondary market incentives to “common carri ers” alone.  Indeed, it would be entirely 
consistent with the stated Congressional objec tives underlying Section 616 to apply the rules 
more broadly as a means of better fostering “the  availability of advanced telecommunications 
services” in “rural areas.”7  Strictly limiting the benefits a nd build-out incentives to established 
“carriers” would exclude many broadband providers that are not deemed at this time to be 
“common carriers,”  and would provi de fewer options for larger ca rriers wishing to disaggregate, 
partition, or lease spectrum to ru ral providers.  As Midcontinen t Communications explained in 
an ex parte  letter filed prior to the NPRM ’s adoption, its own “patchwo rk” of jurisdictions where 
it has been granted Eligible Telecommunications Carrier status would significantly limit its 
ability to obtain benefits if the Commission lim ited those benefits sole ly to those providers 
designated “common carriers,” but  “[t]here is no legitimate policy reason to favor ‘common 
carriers’ over other rural providers that  are not—and cannot be —'common carriers.’”8

The Communications Act of 1934, as amende d (the “Act”) provides the Commission 
ample authority to adopt broader benefits exte nding to any service provider capable of bringing 
the benefits of “advanced telecommunications” to unserved and underserved rural consumers. 
The Commission can rely on the same array of stat utory authorities that it used to adopt the 
initial secondary markets regulations in 2003 to  expand the intended bene fits outlined in the 
MOBILE NOW Act.9  In particular, Section 7( a) of the Act establishes th at “it shall be the policy 
of the United States to encour age the provision of new technologi es and services to the public.”10 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 further highlights the desire to “promote competition and 
reduce regulation in order to s ecure lower prices and higher quality services for American 
telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment  of new telecommunications 
technologies .”11  And the 1997 Balanced Budget Act affo rds the Commission explicit authority 
to allocate electromagnetic spectrum to promote the most efficient use of the spectrum, which 
would include such measures as permitting the creation of smaller geographic areas and 
spectrum assignments through secondary market transa ctions to facilitate improved service to the 
public.12  The Commission also can rely on the recodi fication of Section 257 of the Act in RAY 
BAUM’s Act, which is intended to support inve stment by small companies and entrepreneurs 
generally, a category that would include rural broadband providers.13

repeatedly the goal of ensuring the availability of “advanced telecommunications capability” “without 
regard to any transmission media or technology.”  47 U.S.C. § 1302.",4,Secondary Market Comments.pdf,THE WIRELESS INTERNET SERVICE  PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

Requiring all providers covered by Section 616 (b)(1)(A)(ii) of the MOBILE NOW Act to 
be Title II “carriers” would artificially limit the number and areas wh ere the benefits of 
secondary market transactions contemplated by the NPRM  could be provided.  There is no public 
policy reason for there to be a le gal distinction between small and rural providers able to benefit 
from rule changes and those who are not able to do so.  Limiting new rules only to “common 
carriers” would arbitrarily limit th e pool of eligible providers, decrease the vibrancy of the 
secondary market for larger licensees, and increase  the possibility that ru ral areas will remain 
unserved.  Conversely, extending the scope of th e benefits afforded by enhanced secondary 
market rules would be consistent wi th he MOBILE NOW Act’s overall mandate. 
Accordingly, rather than limiting itself to the narrow scope of entities explicitly identified 
in Section 616, the Commission should establish inclusive definitions of  “unaffiliated covered 
small carrier” and “unaffiliated carrie r to serve a rural area” as follows: 
 An “unaffiliated covered small carrier” is an entity that (1) has filed an FCC Form 
477 for census blocks that overlap or ar e adjacent to the license area to be 
disaggregated, partitioned or leased for at least the two calendar years preceding the transaction,
14 and (2) together with its contro lling interests, affiliates, and the 
affiliates of its control ling interests has fewer than 250,000 combined wireless, 
wireline, broadband, and cable subscribers.15  
 
 An unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area” is an entity that (1) has filed an FCC 
Form 477 for census blocks that overlap or are adjacent to the license area to be 
disaggregated, partitioned or leased for at least the two calendar years preceding the transaction, and (2) se rves predominantly rural areas as defined in Section 616(a)(2) 
of the MOBILE NOW Act. 
 
These criteria are commonly used and understood in  auction contexts, can be easily verified by 
the Commission in part through review of Form 477, and will ensure that  the provider has an 
established track record of providi ng service in either nearby or rural areas.  To give meaning to

the term “unaffiliated” and ensure that the rule  is not misused in contravention to the MOBILE 
NOW Act, the Commission should ma ke clear that the parties to any applicable transaction are 
not affiliated with each other and are not aff iliated with another large nationwide carrier.16  
II. THE COMMISSION SHOULD AFFORD LICENSEES THE FLEXIBILITY 
TO REDUCE THEIR BUILDOUT OBLI GATIONS IN A LIMITED FASHION 
 
The Commission asks “what, if any, incen tives may be appropriate” “that might 
encourage licensees to lease or  sell spectrum,” suggesting that such benefits might include 
license term extensions or m odified performance requirements.17  The Commission should tread 
cautiously to avoid awarding outsized benefits to licensees in an e ffort to spark greater secondary 
market activity.  After all, a significant aspect of  the problem being addresse d is the reluctance of 
these licensees to engage in secondary market transactions at all, th ereby limiting opportunities 
for smaller rural providers.  Accordingly, spec trum licensees engaging in secondary market 
transactions with eligible rura l providers should be subject to  both a “carrot” and a “stick.” 
Licensees that partition, di saggregate or lease spectrum should be afforded some 
additional time to meet buildout obligations for the retained por tion of their li censed areas, but 
also should be subject to both “use it or share it” and “keep what you use” mechanisms.  This 
approach will enhance the incen tives for license holders to monetize unused spectrum through 
the secondary market opti on rather than risk losing spectrum that remains fallow at the end of a 
license term.  It also will provi de major incentives for deployment, especially in rural areas that 
large carriers typically leave unde veloped for long periods while they concentrate on buildout 
efforts in the urban “donut hole” areas.  The “use or share” requirement will provide some 
                                                            
16 As discussed infra , the Commission also should prohibit reaggr egation of the partitioned, disaggregated 
or leased spectrum.  
17 NPRM at 8 (¶25).",6,Secondary Market Comments.pdf,THE WIRELESS INTERNET SERVICE  PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"‐ 8 ‐  
 
opportunistic, unlicensed use that may encourage th e licensee to extend service more quickly, in 
addition to encouraging transactions permitting exclusive use.  
The Commission also seeks comment on whether a nd to what extent eligible rural service 
providers engaging in secondary market transact ions with large carriers should be afforded 
additional time to complete buildout  or relaxed buildout obligations.18  An optimal approach 
might be to give these secondary market license es the option of either two additional years to 
construct or to use non-population-based performance re quirements to dem onstrate substantial 
service.  Also, any interim construction re quirements should not apply to partitioned or 
disaggregated licenses.  
In addition, the Commission should impos e a minimum holding period for licenses 
obtained via partitioning or disaggregation.  Th e small or rural provider obtaining a license 
should be required to hold the partitioned/disaggr egated license at least until it has met the 
applicable buildout requirement for the service.  This requirement will incent faster buildout and 
curb the potential for license-flipping from an initial purchaser to another service provider. 
Finally, the Commission should reject the idea of allowing reaggregation of separated 
license areas or spectrum bloc ks into newly constituted wi de-area licenses where such 
“reaggregated” licenses would be assigned or transferred to any large carrier.19  The objective of 
secondary market transactions s hould be to create ne w opportunities for sma ller and rural service 
providers to obtain licensed spectru m that permits new service to ta rgeted areas that are unserved 
or underserved, and where the larg e provider has determined that the benefits of alienating a 
portion of the license exceed the benefits of retaining it or re turning it to the Commission.  
Allowing larger carriers to reabso rb these right-sized licenses woul d defeat a critical benefit of

encouraging secondary market spectrum tran sactions and would potentially lead to 
gamesmanship by larger carriers, i.e., using an unaffiliated small or rural provider as a 
middleman to convey spectrum indirectly from one large carrier to another.  
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD STRE AMLINE SECONDARY MARKET 
TRANSACTION PROCEDURES  
In order to streamline the cu rrent process governing secondary  market transactions, the 
Commission should relax its fili ng requirements and adopt provisions that are similar the 
notification and immediate applic ation procedures that currently  apply to spectrum manager and 
short-term leasing arrangements.
20  The Commission can require parties to certify that they are 
either an “unaffiliated covered small carrier” or an “unaffiliated carrier to serve a rural area” and that the transaction complies with Commission rules,  but it is not necessary for these transactions 
to appear on public notice and be subject to  a full 30-day comment period prior to Commission 
action.  As a practical matter, there are very few petitions to deny transac tion applications, which 
results in the overwhelming majority of these filings being granted on a routine basis. 
In the rare instance where a significant, subs tantive objection may exis t to the assignment 
of spectrum rights to a purchaser or lessee, th e Commission’s rules will continue to allow for 
reconsideration of the grant.
21  If warranted under appropriate  circumstances, the Commission 
could immediately rescind grant of an assignment ei ther in response to seri ous concerns raised in 
a petition or on its own motion.22  Allowing the vast majority of routine secondary market 
transactions to move forward without delay will reduce transactional costs and burdens on 
                                                            
20 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.9020 & 1.9035.  The Commission should streamline its procedures for partitioning, 
disaggregation and leasing of all licensed spectrum, not just those involving “eligible rural providers.”  
21 47 C.F.R. § 1.9020(e)(2)(iv) (indicating that spect rum manager lease notifications are subject to the 
Commission’s reconsideration rules); 47 C.F.R. §1.9035( e)(3) (same for applications for consent to short-
term leasing arrangements).

licensees, lessees and purchasers alike, as  well as reducing administrative burdens on 
Commission staff.  Moreover, rapid approval wi ll allow those acquiring sp ectrum rights to begin 
build-out activities sooner, pr oviding more time for actual constr uction and very likely bringing 
new service to rural consumers on an expedite d basis by substantially  reducing the lag time 
between agreement to sell or lease spectrum and administrative approval of such transactions. 
Conclusion 
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, WISPA urge s the Commission to expand the scope of 
eligibility for updated rules governing partitionin g, aggregation and leasing to small and rural 
providers of advanced telecommunications capability.   The Commission should also afford 
licensees on both sides of a secondary market transaction some flexibility to reduce their 
performance requirements to incent such activ ity.  Finally, the Comm ission should streamline 
secondary market transaction approval procedures  to base them on notification rather than 
approval following public notice in a manner simila r to the procedures that apply to spectrum 
manager and short-term lease agreements.

COMMENTS OF MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS  
 Midcontinent Communications (Midco) supports the Commission taking action to allow 
for more robust partitioning, disaggregation, and licensing and leasing of spectrum, especially in 
rural areas.1  Midco is submitting comments separate from our trade associations2 to highlight a 
particular area of concern —limiting future partition and disaggregation rules to “carriers.”3   
 The term “carrier” implies that a company needs eligible telecommunications carrier 
(ETC) status or a C ertificat e of A uthority to benefit from the new spectrum licensing and leasing 
rules.  While Midco has ETC status in some of our markets , we do not (and cannot) receive ETC

benefit ting from the new rules.  Therefore, we encourage the Commission to  clarify that  eligible 
entities need not have ETC  status or a Certificate of Authority to use the new ru les.  We also 
suggest other safeguards to ensure that rural providers are using the s pectrum to advance the

INTRODUCTION  
 Midco has  operated for more than 85 years in the rural areas of the Upper Midwest, 
beginning with operating movie theat ers and radio stations, and then owning the first televi sion 
station in South Dakota.  In April of 1996, in Aberdeen, South Dakota ( with a population of 
about 25,000  at the time ), we launched our  first internet service.    
 We have since aggressively expanded our broadband wired service.  We offer Gigabit to 
more than 90% of our wired network, and are beginning construction and upgrades to offer 
symmetrical, 10 Gigabit service as part of the 10G Initiative .  We have almost 10,000 miles of 
fiber, the vast majority of which is in our upper Midwestern territory in North Dakota, South 
Dakota, and rural Minnesota.4  Currently, we serve almost 400,000 customers, and have more 
than 1,600 employees in our five state territory.5     
 Although we serve rural  areas with our wired network, we wanted to do more to serve the 
most remote areas of our footprint.  Therefore, in March of 2018, Midco acquired a fixed 
wireless provider with more than 10 years’ experience  providing  broadband in the Red River 
                                                           
4 While our fiber network passes through the Twin Cities in Minnesota, we do not provide any 
services in the Twin Cities.  Instead,  we focus our operations  in rural Minnesota.    
5 In addition to operations in South Dakota, North Dakota, and rural Minnesota, Midco also has 
limited operations in western Wisconsin, and the Lawrence area in Kansas.",1,Midco.Secondary Markets.Comments 6.3.2019 Final.pdf,MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 Valley in northern North Dakota and Minnesota .  Since that acquisition, Midco  has made a large 
public commitment to further closing the Digital Divide using fixed wireless technology  with our 
award of about $38.9 Million in Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF)  funds .   
 Continuing access to spectrum is key for our fixed wireless operations  and those of other 
operators  that primarily  serve  rural America .  By  modernizing the licensing and leasing rules and 
broadening the eligible entities to use the new rules , the Commission  could further close the 
Digital  Divide.  
DISCUSSION  
 As summarized by the Commission, the MOBILE NOW Ac t requires “that the 
Commission initiate a rulemaking  to consider specific  questions related to the parti tioning or 
disaggregation of spectrum licenses and spectrum leasing as a potential means to increase 
availability  of advanced telecommunications services in rural areas  and spectrum access by 
small carriers.”6  Disaggregation and partition of licenses and leasing is an important step in 
closing the Digital Divide,7 but only if companies committed to serving rural America are able to 
benefit from the new rules.  
 Midco is concerned about the term “carrier,” specifically in the “unaffiliated carrier to 
serve a rural area” in Section 616 of the MOBILE NOW Act.8  “Carrier” implies that only 
companies that are cove red common carriers  pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934 would

7 NPRM ¶ 1 (“As part of the Commission’s continuing efforts to close the digital divide and to 
increase spectrum access by small and rural carriers, the Commission adopts this Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking  exploring how potential changes to our partitioning , disaggregation, and 
leasing rules might better serve those goals.”).

 be able to benefit from the partition and disaggregation rules.  As we previously noted, we are 
concerned that “carrier” could limit the new rules only to covered carriers having ETC stat us or a 
Certificate of Authority .9   
 As the Commission knows, ETC status is complex, especially  for CLECs like Midco.  
Our ETC status varies state-by-state and market by market, depending on whether the market ha s 
a rural local exchange carrier or is a competitive market.  The attached Exhibit 1 summarizes our 
ETC status for Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota.  In South Dakota, for example, we 
currently offer phone in 53 markets, but we only have ETC status in 40 of those markets.10 
 The situation  becomes even more complex for our CAF  areas.  In South Dakota, for 
example, we were granted an Amended Certificate of Authority and ETC “to provide local 
exchange service  in certain [i.e., CAF] census blocks in South Dakota[.]”11  Figure 1 provides a 
visual depiction of this authority —we can and will offer voice and reimbursable  Lifeline to 
                                                           
9 See generally Letter from Nicole Tupman, Assistant General Counsel, Midcontinent 
Communications, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WT Docket 19 -38, at 1 (March 7, 
2019); see also NPRM  ¶ 20 & n.39 (citing the same); Id. ¶ 13 & n.34 (“Section 616 directs the 
Commission to use the definition of “carrier” contained in sect ion 3 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, which defines a carrier as “any person engaged as a common carrier for hire, in 
interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or interstate or foreign radio transmission of 
energy . . . but a person engaged i n radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such person is so 
engaged, be deemed a common carrier.”).  
10 See Exhibit 1 at 1.  Exhibit 1 does not include our CAF ETC areas, or our ETC areas for 
Kansas or Wisconsin.   Depending on the states, our ETC or Certifi cate of Authority status , or 
lack thereof, may prevent us from applying for reimbursable Lifeline.      
11 See Exhibit 2, SD Public Utilities Commission, Order Granting Amended Certificate of 
Authority , TC18 -058, at 1-2.",3,Midco.Secondary Markets.Comments 6.3.2019 Final.pdf,MIDCONTINENT COMMUNICATIONS,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"

 customers in the tan, CAF blocks, but cannot offer 
voice or reimbursable  Lifeline to customers in the 
white, non -CAF blocks, even though our fixed 
wireless signal will extend beyond the CAF blocks.   
 While we can determine our ability to offer 
voice and reimbursable  Lifel ine in our ETC 
authorized areas, using ETC status to determine our 
ability to take advantage of new partition and 
disaggregation rules for spectrum is impossible.  Would we, for example, only be able to use the 
rules in areas where we have ETC  status or a Certificate of Authority?  What if the spectrum 
license area included some markets where we do not have ETC status or a Certificate of 
Authority, but some areas where we do have such authority?  W e are not alone in this dilemma —
tying “carrier” to ETC statu s or a Certificate of Authority would likely affect WISPs and rural 
broadband providers that may not have any (or only limited)  “carrier”  status.  
 We encourage the Commission to clarify these questions by more  broadly defin ing 
“carrier” to include a servi ces provider that is an incumbent or com petitive local exchange 
carrier,  a cable television system operator,  or a terrestrial fixed wireless provider (including 
wireless ISPs, or WISPs) that provid es service to end user premises .12  Alternatively, the 
Commission could allow a provider to benefit from the new rules for any spectrum license or 
lease in a state in which the provider has ETC status or a Certificate of Authority in at least one 
market  in the state .   
                                                           
12 As these entities must file a Form 477, there is precedent for the  Commission to expand the 
definition of “carrier” to include such entities.

"6 
  To encourage advanc ed telecommunications in rural America and prevent spectrum 
warehousing by large, national carriers, the Commission could institute other requirements for a 
provider to take advantage of the new rules.  The Commission has already provided some 
safeguards, such as the definition of “rural area,”13 which Midco supports. The Commission 
could also require that a provider has been active in the area in which the license or lease will be 
acquired, such as requiring that the provider seeking the spectrum has filed a Form 477 for the 
census blocks within or adjacent to the spectrum license or lease to be partitioned, disaggregated, 
or acquired.   To ensure that the carrier is providing “advanced telecommunications,” the 
Commission could  also require that the provider is, or with the spectrum will be, providing 
services at a certain speed and latency threshold, such as a minimum speed of 25/3 Mbps.     
CONCLUSION  
 Midco urges the Commission to more broadly define “carrier” and allow rural providers 
to take advantage of the proposed spectrum leasing and licensing rule changes.  Specifically, the 
Commission should expand “carrier” to include providers that do not have ETC or Certificate of 
Authority , especially for rural areas , with appropriate safeguards .

On October 22, 2018, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (Commission) received 
a petition from Midcontinent Communications (Midco) for an amended certificate of authority to 
provide local exchange service in certain census blocks in South Dakota as well as requesting a 
waiver of ARSD 20:10:32:15. Midco has been awarded Connect America Fund II (CAF II) funding 
from the Federal Communi cations Commission and is required to obtain eligible 
telecommunications carrier status in all of the census blocks in which Midco was awarded CAF II 
funding (CAF II Census Blocks). 
On October 25, 2018, Commission electronically transmitted notice of the filing and the 
intervention deadline November 9, 2018, to interested individuals and entities on the 
Commission's PUC Weekly Filings electronic listserv. On November 9, 2018, the South Dakota 
Telecommunications Association (SOTA) filed a Petition to Intervene and Venture 
Communications Cooperative (Venture), Santel Communications Cooperative (Santel), and 
Interstate Telecommunications Cooperative, Inc. (ITC) filed a Joint Petition to Intervene 
(collectively, ""lntervenors""). On November 29, 2018, intervention was granted to the lntervenors. 
On January 4, 2019, a Joint Stipulation for Settlement and a settlement agreement between the 
lntervenors and Midco was filed with the Commission. 
On January 18, 2019, at its regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission considered the

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum  
 WT Docket No. 19 -38 
 
 
Dear Ms. Dortch:  
 
 Select Spectrum LLC is a professional licensed spectrum brokerage  firm that currently 
represents licensees across 18 FCC -licensed spectrum bands, ranging from 150 MHz to 40 GHz.  
Our company has facilita ted hundreds of leases  and sales of spectrum licenses , including both 
geographic and spectral partitions,  under the current rule structure.  We have experience  working 
with a variety of stakeholders in the secondary market ( licensees, lessors, lessees, spectrum buyers , 
etc.), and are  familiar with the associated FCC process es. We agree that the  methods in place by 
the Commission should evolve to  become  more efficient , effective  and robust .  While the 
Commission’s methods have improved over time , the implementation of emerging innovati ve 
spectrum applications now require s the support of improved and streamlined FCC processes .  
Ultimately, a more efficient  version of the Commission’s processes  will be required to  maximiz e 
spectrum usage  by all prospective users .  
 
 The Commission should  consider  implementing the overnight Immediate Approval 
Process (IAP) and  grant filed applications for most typical transactions such as assignments, sales, 
leases, and partitions – for a higher percentage of license transactions . Currently the IAP applies 
in certain cases, but it should be used for all typical situations where there is no clear reason to 
conduct  a more extensive review .  When a transaction encompasses an additional layer of 
complexity,  such as competitive analysi s, the approval timing understandably may be extended, 
but such reviews should still be  rare and when required should be  carried out as rapidly as possible .  
Once a respective application is granted, per the mutual agreement between the licensee and lessee  
or buyer, the application should be consummated promptly, and  closing notice s should be  filed 
promptly .  If this accelerated  process above is implemented  by the FCC and licensees, lessors and 
lessees , it will serve to accelerate the vast majority of spect rum transactions , which would assist 
in putting spectrum to its best use more quickly.   Such changes will facilitate more and faster  
spectrum  transactions , which  will serve to better support the adoption of unprecedented spectrum 
use cases as the nation implements Internet of Things and 5G connectivity.  
 
As the FCC increases the availability of commercial spectrum  (e.g. CBRS1), a more 
efficient process becomes increasingly critical .  Demand for licensed spectrum  continues to  grow  
and the FCC has expressed a goal of maximizing the use of existing spectrum but to do so  a more  
system atic process must be applied.  Using CBRS as an  example, there is a reasonable expectation 
                                                      
1 Citizens Broadband Radio Service",0,NPRM_Docket1938_190603commentsSSL.pdf,Select Spectrum LLC,"Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum"
"that there will be a significant demand for short -term leases,  perhaps as short as a few hours or a 
few days .  Under the current process, i n some scenarios, the  time to file and to receive acceptance 
of a lease a nd/or partition could  exceed the duration of  the lease established between lessor and 
lessee .  Since  the Commission ’s objective  is for spectrum to be used to its highest potential, the 
filing and grant process must accommodate such short -term scenarios.    
 
Aside from CBRS,  wherever feasible,  the IAP approach  should be applied to other bands, 
such as Educational Broadband Service (EBS ) and Broadband Radio Service (BRS), 600 MHz, 
and the many  sub-1GHz narrowband frequency bands govern ed by Part 22, Part 27, Part 90, and 
Part 95 rules .  Reducing transaction costs by addressing these avoidable complexities and approval 
delays that are  associated with conducting transactions will create favorable outcomes as more 
users will put more spectrum to good use.   
 
Benefits intended by the proposed rules should not only apply to common carriers as 
defined in Section 616 of MOBILE NOW Act2, but also  to fixed wireless rural broadband 
providers  and critical infrastructure industry entities such as electric , gas  & water  utilities  and 
passenger & freight rail lines .  The Commission has determined that the best and highest use of 
spectrum is facilitated by opening licensing to a broad range of users, and all qualified users should 
benefit from the efficiencies identified in the Act, the Docket and these comments.  Restricting 
benefits  and build -out incentives to common carriers alone would exclude numerous important 
spectrum users and  provide fewer  options for larger carriers that seek to disaggregate, partition, or 
lease spectrum to such service providers.  With access to the right spectrum assets, t hese non-
common carrier organizations can increase the public good by  assist ing in bridging the digital 
divide , closing the homework gap in rural areas  and/or providing services that promo te public 
safety  and support economic activity and /or convenience .  Rules and benefits should not exclude , 
but instead be provided equally , to all qualified licensees and lessees .  
 
The FCC’s Universal Licensing System “ULS”  is an important repository of spectrum data 
and is critical to the FCC’s review and approval of spectrum transactions including sales, leases, 
and geographic and spectrum partitions. W e also want to strongly recommend that the FCC invest 
money and expertise to improve the reliability and functionality of “ULS”. While the system 
usually works, it  also has exhibited  frequent  problems with errors and outages. Errors have 
included the incorrect translation of properly submitted license information into different and 
incorrect licenses and in some cases the inability of ULS  to accept properly filed geographic 
coordinates when attempting to identify a geographic portion of a license as being leased. We 
generally find FCC staff to be responsive when such problems are encountered, but resolution of 
the problems takes time, and in certain cases in order to simply allow the lease  
application/notification to be accepted by ULS without creating errors that could not be resolved 
within a reasonable period of time , our clients have had to accept countywide partitions  rather than 
the smaller scale of coordinates tha t they would have preferred.

COMMENTS OF THE R STREET INSTITUTE  
In this proceeding, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) seeks to  
further the Commission’s goals of closing the digital divide and increasing access to spectrum by small 
and rural carriers through reforms of its partitioning, disaggregatio n, and leasing rules.1 Secondary -market 
transactions such as these  are essential t o the functioning of the wireless marketplace . Therefore,  the 
Commission can best accomplish its goals by removing regulatory barriers to these transactions for all 
spectrum users.  
I. Secondary markets promote productive spectrum use  
The goal of the Commission’s spectrum policy should be productive allocation and use of radio 
frequencies . This  goal is best served by relying on markets for flexible rights.2 Markets tend to direct 
spectrum to productive uses by allowing parties that can put them to more  profitable uses to buy them

 from those with less -profitable business models. However, transaction c osts can hamper this process and 
reduce the number of mutually beneficial deals that would otherwise enhance the productive use of 
spectrum.3 While the Comm ission has taken positive steps to implement more market -based assignment s 
of spectrum rights, transaction costs remain a major barrier to parties  seeking to engage in secondary -
market transactions.  
In some cases , the Commission’s own rules are the source  of these transaction costs. The current 
rules import the legacy o f government control over radio -operating rights , which we now know was 
overbroad from the start.4 Spectrum rights  can be allocated by markets just like any other scarce 
resource, and regulatory overhead on market transactions usually serves only to make  that process less 
efficient. To the extent permitted by statute, therefore, the Commission should allow  licensees t o enter 
contracts to partition, disaggregate, or lease their rights without having to obtain permission from the 
FCC.  
II. Secondary -market transactions should not require Commission approval  
The central question of this proceeding is the extent to which the FCC should intervene in the 
market for spectrum licenses. Currently, t he Commission requires long and arduous  proceedings to take 
place before many secondary -market transactions can be approved.5 These processes dr amatically 
increase transaction  costs and reduce the ability of secondary -market deals to direct  spectrum rights to 
more productive users. Reducing these costs would encourage private deals and invite more players into 
the market —including small and rural carriers  who do not currently have the res ources to pursue an FCC 
proceeding to its conclusion. Therefore, the Commission should declare that secondary -market 
transactions are presumptively approved and only impose regulatory barriers where there is substantial

4 That legacy is one of using scarcity as a justification for government control. However, scarcity exists in all 
markets for economic goods and do es not necessitate government inte rvention.  Ronald H. Coase, “The Federal 
Communications Commission,” The Journal of Law and Economics  2 (October 1959).

 likelihood of tangible harm.  If the Commission does not decide to remove itself entirely from review of 
secondary -market deals, it should nonetheless set a threshold —either in bandwidth or licensee  revenue —
below which secondary -market deals do not require FCC review.6 
This approach not only encourages efficient use of spectrum, it comports well with the 
Commission’s desire that refor ms be administratively feasible ,7 since a llowing more secondary -market 
transactions to take place without involving the Commission would reduce the burde n on administrative 
resources.  
III. Modifying performance requirements would reduce transaction costs  
The Commission asks about potentially reducing the extent to which performance requirements 
attach to spectrum rights  acquired through  the secondary market.8 Performance requirement s currently 
represent a substantial  transaction cost b ecause they arbitrarily attach  external requirements to private 
deals. The Commission should note the mere fact that spectrum is not being used at a given time is no t 
proof of inef ficiency or market failure ; there may be good reason to delay deployment to some areas 
based on factors such as investment cycles, economic conditions, or approa ching technological 
evolutions.  But if spectrum that an original licensee does not wish to use and that another provider wishes 
to buy continues to remain fallow, transaction costs are likely obstructing efficient allocation , since 
secondary -market transactions would result in more productive use if transaction costs are sufficiently 
low.9 Commission rules that dictate when and how deplo yment must take place provide an example of 
such unnecessary  transaction cost s and are, therefore, counterproductive to the goal of efficient allocation  
and deployment in rural areas . Relaxing these rules an d allowing private parties to negotiate on the basis 
of on-the-ground realities will be more likely to result in a productive outcome.

 IV. Allowing reaggregation is essential to well -functioning markets  
The Commission also seeks comment on allowing reaggregati on of licenses that have previously 
been disaggregated.10 Allowing market transactions , in any reasonable sense,  means allowing the se 
transactions  to go both ways. Permitting free reaggregation alongside disa ggregation would not only 
allow more flexibility in the use of spectrum over time, it would also incentivize  initial licensees to 
participate in the secondary market in the first place. Incumbents may hesitate  to sell or lease part of their 
license if they will never be able to reacquire it , and this reticence may result in spectrum remaining 
trapped  in unproductive uses.  However, if licensees know they can buy back pieces of a license  that they 
have previously disaggregated , this reduces the expected cost of disaggregating  it in the first pl ace. 
 The Commission expresses concern that, if allowed, reaggregation may be used to evade 
construction requirements.11 But, as explained above, these requirements are themselves detrimental to 
productive spectrum use and should be reduced  or eliminated  anyway. If the Commission is committed to 
keeping construction requirements, it could avoid this difficulty by allowing reaggregation only after the 
original construction requirements for the aggregate license area have been met.  
V. The Commission should take a broader look at transaction costs in secondary 
markets  
While the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“ NPRM ”) takes positive steps toward allowing 
greater flexibility in secondary markets, it is unnecessarily narrow in its approach. Instead, t he 
Commission sho uld take a broad look at its rules for secondary -market transactions for all types of current 
and potential licensees and bands.   
For example, the NPRM mistakenly focuses  on small carriers and rural geographic areas to the 
exclusion of others.12 The same lo gic that makes the proposed reforms beneficial in rural areas also 
applies in non -rural areas. While urban areas may not typically suffer from completely unused spectrum

 to the same extent as rural areas, inefficiencies do not always manifest as disuse. Th e high transaction 
costs of secondary markets are equally as likely to  result in spectrum remaining caught  in less productive 
uses as they are to result  in rural areas not being served at all .13 While more difficult to see, this 
opportunity cost is no less real  than the more visible costs of completely fallow spectrum . Lowering 
transaction costs in all spectrum markets will open up the possibility of profitable deals driving  spectrum 
rights to mo re productive users, thus benefiting consumers.  
In a broader examination of secondary -market reform, t he Commission might  seek to balance the 
reduction in licensees’ performance requirements with increased allowance for opportunistic use of 
spectrum  that i s not currently in use by a licensee . Licensees have a legal right not to be interfered with, 
but if another operator can make use of a band without interfering with the licensee, then no violation of 
that right  has occurred . Expanding opportunistic use, h owever, depends on technological advancements, 
such as those being attempted in the 3.5 GHz band. The Commission should encourage such efforts but 
refuse to allow opportunistic use if it is not possible to consistently p rotect the rights of licensees  in do ing 
so. 
The Commission may also consider a common ownership self -assessed tax approach —such as 
that which was proposed for the 3.5 GHz proceeding14—in which the licensees must declare a dollar 
value for their licenses and be compelled to sell or lease the l icense to others at that price.15 The valuation 
would require  licensees to pay a small percentage of the offered price  to the Commission . A similar 
mechanism could also be applied to interference thresholds such that licensees are rewarded for building 
more  fault-tolerant networks that will accept more interference, thus allowing more intensive use of 
                                                             
13 For example , satellite  spectrum may be  better used for mobile data, as will likely be the outcome of the 3.7 -4.2 
GHz proceeding. Federal Communications Commission, Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band , Notice

 licensed spectrum.16 While the net benefits of this approach are still unclear in practice, it is worthy of 
additional study and experimentation by the Commissi on. 
Lastly, the Commission should create a more user -friendly  database of spectrum licenses that 
clearly identifies licensees, the frequencies to which they have rights, and geographic and other details 
about the licenses  they own . These data are currently  difficult to access , which imposes barriers on 
potential buyers and sellers —particularly small and rural carriers who may have less experience with the 
Commission’s databases. A more useful database would allow potential buyers and sellers to find each 
other and conclude deals that are beneficial to both parties and , in turn,  to American consumers.17 
The Commission should continue its efforts to allow markets to allocate spectrum rights in all 
areas of the country and should seek to remove the regulatory barriers that now hamper that process.

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
A few months ago, I had the chance to meet Whitney from Lambert, Montana.  Her family runs a 
farming and ranching operation in the northeast corner of Big Sky Country.  The area is famous for being 
the farthest place in the country from a Starbucks.  It’s about 190 miles to the closest green-aproned 
barista.  A run to the grocery store is a 100-mile drive round trip.  The nearest big city, Billings, is five 
and a half hours away.  
Yet Whitney is an Instagram star.  She makes money by using her smartphone to produce and 
upload what have become viral videos.  She calls one of her more famous videos “CrossFit for Cows,”1 
and it’s been viewed millions of times.  It shows Ghost, one of her 1,200 pound Herefords, rolling a straw 
bale across a snow-covered field.  Whitney can get 4G LTE when she’s in the field because there’s a cell 
tower not far away that was put up to cover a highway that runs through the area.  But there are still too 
many people in rural America that can’t get a 4G LTE signal.
And that is why the FCC is working on a number of fronts to help close this digital divide.  We 
have allocated up to $4.5 billion to bring 4G LTE to more Americans.  We have streamlined broadband 
infrastructure rules.  And we have sought comment on expanding the FCC’s existing geographic coverage 
requirements.2
Today, we tee up another option for increasing wireless service in rural America.  As required by 
Congress in the MOBILE NOW Act, we seek comment on how our spectrum leasing and related rules 
can help promote wireless deployment in areas that might otherwise go unserved.
Now, everyone may not have the same social media skills as Whitney, but they should at least 
have the same opportunity at next-gen connectivity.  So I support today’s Notice, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on these important issues.

Re: Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum, WT Docket No. 19-38
Two weeks ago, on my first visit outside the beltway as an FCC Commissioner, I traveled to 
Kansas City, Missouri, along with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, who represents Missouri’s Fifth 
District.  We were eager to learn more about the work being done on the ground to help close the digital 
divide in Kansas City and how we, in Washington, could help facilitate, support and amplify those 
efforts. 
Among many stops, I attended a meeting of the Kansas City Coalition for Digital Inclusion, a 
group formed for the singular purpose of addressing the digital divide in Kansas City.  Comprised of 
representatives from area nonprofits, government entities, and businesses, as well as individuals, the 
group is “focused on fostering internet access and digital readiness in greater Kansas City.”  Missouri 
ranks 41st in the U.S. in connectivity and internet access, so it is abundantly clear that when it comes to 
ensuring every American can benefit from the transformative power of robust and affordable broadband, 
we have our work cut out for us, in Missouri and across the nation.
To that end, I welcome any and all ideas that show promise in helping us bridge the digital divide.  
I am pleased to support today’s item, which fulfills Congress’ directive in the MOBILE NOW Act and 
explores how potential changes to the Commission’s partitioning, disaggregation, and leasing rules would 
increase small carriers’ access to spectrum, expand the availability of broadband in rural areas, and 
advance our collective goal of closing the digital divide.  I look forward to reviewing the record that 
develops in this proceeding and challenge stakeholders to put forward their best and most innovative 
ideas.

Re: In the Matter of Partitioning, Disaggregation, and Leasing of Spectrum , NPRM, WT 
Docket No. 19 -38, FCC -CIRC1903 -06 
Dear Ms. Dortch : 
Midcontinent Communications (Midco) appreciates the Commission’s consideration of the Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)  to free up more spectrum for rural America .  Midco would like to 
raise the issue of defining “carrier” with Commission prior to the March 15, 2019, meeting and 
potential adoption of the NPRM.   We are concerned that the definition of “carrier”  from Section 616 
of the MOBILE N OW Act does not include many rur al broadband providers, including Midco, that 
are no t “common carriers .”  
While w e could be interested in purchasing spectrum from a large carrier, we are not an Eligible 
Telecommunications Carrier  (ETC ) in our entire footprint, and in 
many areas we are ETC for Lifeline purposes only.   The tan blocks 
in the fig ure to the right, for example, show  our ETC status for 
Connect America Fund Phase II census blocks .  We do not have 
ETC status in the surrounding white space.  Nor would we be able 
to receive ETC status in  the white space due to the rules for rural 
local e xchange carriers.   The result is a patchwork of ETC status , 
which could enable a small class of “common carriers” to enjoy the 
benefits of additional spectrum and limit our ability to obtain the same benefits.  There is no 
legitimate policy reason to favor “common carriers” over other  rural providers that are not —and 
cannot be —“common carriers.”         
Therefore, we urge the Commission to request comment in the upcoming NPRM on whether the 
proposed rules should be extended to broadband providers that are not “carri ers” as defined in the 
MOBILE N OW Act.   
Sincerely,
