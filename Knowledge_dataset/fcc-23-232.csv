"1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  
NCTA – The Internet & Television Association ( “NCTA” )1 hereby submits these reply 
comments in response to the Federal Communications Commission’s ( “Commission ”) recent 
Notice of Inquiry (“ NOI”) seeking to gain greater insight into non- Federal spectrum use.2  The 
record in this proceeding strongly supports the Commission’s focus on improving access to 
accurate and reliable data on spectrum use and confirms that  a one-size-fits-all approach will not 
achieve this goal .  Commenters generally agree that the Commission should design measurement 
efforts to serve a well -articulated goal and consider the characteristics of the particular band 
under study.  The response to the NOI  also demonstrates that the Commission should analyze a 
band’s overall public utility and should not tr eat received power  or channel occupancy  as a proxy 
for utility .  Importantly, however, suggestions that the Commission should not study spectrum 
use in licensed -exclusive bands and that unlicensed and shared -use bands lack incentives to 
promote spectral efficiency  are incorrect .  
I. THE RECORD SUPPORTS MEASURING  PUBLIC UTILITY RATHER THAN 
BAND OCCUPANCY OR RECEIVED POWER.  
Commenters demonstrate that f ocusing on one rigid metric as a proxy for utility, such as 
band occupancy or received power, risks producing an inaccurate assessment of a  band’s 
utilization  and public utility.  In particular , several commenters note that measuring  channel

which is the leading provider of residential broadband service to U.S. households. Its members include owners and operators of cable television systems serving more than 80 percent of the nation’s cable television customers, as well as more than 200 cable program networks. Cable service providers have invested more than $300 billion over the last two decades to deploy and continually upgrade networks and other infrastructure —including 
licensed mobile wireless and some of the nation’s largest Wi -Fi- networks.

"2 occupancy does not accurately capture spectrum utilization.3  For example, AT&T explains that 
channel occupancy inaccurately measures actual utility  and points to the example of “a radio 
transmitter broadcasting a signal that is not received by any users.”4  The radio transmitter would 
register “ use” based on channel occupancy even though it would not actually provide any “real 
use” or public value.5  Professors Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett, and Michael Honig similarly 
underscore, “ [s]pectrum occupancy statistics do not map value generation.”6 
Just as the goal of measuring channel occupancy would not reliably capture public  utility, 
neither would the tactic of measuring  received power.  As AT&T explain s, “[s]ignal strength 
alone  . . . fails to adequately capture spectrum usage—for some radio applications and 
deployment scenarios, the use of tall towers and high- power transmitters is less efficient than a 
distributed network of shorter antenna height operations at a lower power.”7  Wi-Fi is a powerful 
illustration of  this point.  As NCTA highlighted in its initial comments , low power levels, low 
activity factors, and predominantly indoor operation make Wi -Fi a particularly spectrally 
efficient technology.8  Therefore, even though Wi -Fi is a critical part  of the modern digital 
economy, a measurement approach that  only factors in received power at outdoor listening points

"3 could register substantially less “use” of an unlicensed band than is actually the case.  Such a 
crude metric would fail to capture Wi -Fi’s immense social utility.  
NCTA recommends that the Commission use this proceeding to establish a set of 
measurement principles  to guide it in designing measurement approaches in future individual 
proceedings  rather than adopting a one -size- fits-all approach .  Specifically , as described more 
fully in NCTA’s  initial comments, the Commission should adopt three principles : (1) any 
measurement approach should be tailored to the Commission’s intended use of the data; (2) any 
analytic approach employed by the Commission should be neutral and avoid over - or 
undervaluing a particular service or technology; and (3)  usage measurement should not become a 
tool for blocking Commission action.9  Establishing these overarching principles will ensure that 
any assessment of a particular band will avoid being skewed by unreliable metrics that may be part of a one -size-fits-all measurement approach, such as band occupancy or received power .  
There is abundant agreement in the record that a one -size- fits-all approach is not possible,
10 and 
other commenters similarly suggest adopting guiding principles .11

"4 II. THE COMMISSION’S  UNLICENSED AND SHARED- LICENSED 
FRAMEWORKS INCENTIVIZE HIGH UTILIZATION AND EFFICIENCY.  
The Commission’s  measurement policies should be technology agnostic , with a design 
that does not advantage any one technology, network type , or spectrum use framework .12  CTIA, 
however, asks the Commission to not  measure exclusively licensed bands based on a claim that 
exclusive licensing will automatically produce full and efficient use of a band even without 
Commission oversight or measurement.13  Instead, CTIA recommends  that the Commission 
focus measurement on unlicensed and shared- licensed bands because it asserts that these 
spectrum -use mechanisms do not incentivize efficient use.14  Both assertions are false.  
A. The Commission Should Include Exclusively Licensed Bands in 
Measurement Efforts . 
The Commission should reject CTIA’s request that Commission data -gathering efforts 
skip exclusively licensed bands.  CTIA asserts that exclusive licenses automatically produce full 
utilization, so no scrutiny of these operations is required.15  This is incorrect  on both fronts .  
Exclusive licenses produce high barriers to entry and the opportunity for companies to prevent 
their rivals from accessing spectrum to undermine competition , both of which result in less 
efficiency .

and offering recommended data definitions, structure, and formatting standards. It lays the foundation for a consistent and efficient evaluation of spectrum usage.”) , Comments of

"5 CTIA’s claim that exclusively licensed spectrum is fully utilized is also incorrect , as 
demonstrated by significant gaps in coverage across the country.  A bipartisan coalition of 
senators led by Senator Roger Wicker  underscored, “ For too long, millions of rural Americans 
have been living without consistent and reliable mobile broadband service. ”16  Representative 
Peter Welch specifically characterized T -Mobile and Sprint’s coverage claims in Vermont as 
“bogus.”17  He stated, “in a lot of Vermont we have no G” and pointed to a study by the Vermont 
Department of Public Service that found that 62 percent of the areas studied showed no T-Mobile service and 50 percent showed no AT&T service.
18  The licensed -exclusive spectrum 
use framework allows this under -utilization and, unlike the unlicensed or licensed- shared 
frameworks, entrenches the problem because it blocks other companies from filling the gaps left from underinvestment.  In either an unlicensed or shared- licensed band another company could 
easily step in and serve these communities , but exclusive licensing prevents this marketplace 
reaction.  
B. Unlicensed and Licensed -Shared Bands H ave Strong  Efficiency I ncentives.  
The conclusion that unlicensed and licensed -shared bands lack incentives for efficient use 
is also demonstrably wrong.
19  First , as noted in NCTA’s original comments, unlicensed 
operations promote efficiencies that result in full utilization of available spectrum.  T he

"6 extraordinary nationwide proliferation of Wi-Fi alone  shows that the unlicensed spectrum -use 
framework produces intense investment and deployment.20  Wi-Fi systems are also highly 
efficient  spectrum  users, supporting billions of devices and far more traffic than exclusively 
licensed networks.  In particular, Wi -Fi’s use of lower power levels and contention- based 
protocols results in high throughputs and low latency even in densely populated environments .21  
Importantly, unlike exclusively licensed bands, unlicensed bands  also have very low  barrier s to 
entry .  Any user can access an unlicensed band using Wi -Fi, Bluetooth, or one of many other 
technologies, without needing an FCC license or the permission of any other user of the band.  
Consequently, if unlicensed frequencies are underutilized in any particular location, a new user can use these frequencies easily .  The Commission’s unlicensed framework means that there is 
no advantage to spectrum warehousing, and the market can quickly and efficiently react to any 
failure to build  out in a location.  In addition, the  low power levels used by Wi -Fi and other 
unlicensed technologies make it far easier for unlicensed operations to coexist with incumbent users in a band without causing harmful interference, resulting in many instances where frequencies or location s unusable by high- power , exclusively licensed technologies are 
efficiently and robustly utilized by unlicensed devices . 
Second, the licensed -shared spectrum use framework also supports high utilization and 
efficiency.  As Lockheed Martin explained, “ [s]pectrum sharing and co -existence among users 
has naturally evolved in such a competitive spectral environment, and, as a result, these bands 
are highly utilized in terms of time, spectrum, and geographic utilization.”

"7 like the  Citizens Band Radio Service (“CBRS”) band, provide flexible access to a wide range of 
users with far lower barriers to entry  than in exclusively licensed bands .  This enables  diverse  
spectrum access in a market that the Commission  has determined is highly concentrated because 
of the dominant spectrum holdings of the three largest mobile wireless companies.  Furthermore , 
NTIA’s CBRS report demonstrates that the band is being heavily utilized by this larger group of 
users .23  As of the beginning of this year, NTIA found that  there were over 285,000 active CBRS 
Devices (“CBSDs”).24  Of those CBSDs, 128,351 were located in Dynamic Protection Area 
(“DPA”) counties with a total population of 232,348,897 residents.25  DPAs are areas in which 
federal incumbent operators may be operating systems that require protection.26  In the absence 
of the dynamic CBRS sharing framework, which allows commercial operators to provide services when protected systems are not in use, the resi dents living in a DPA would not have  
access to the band.  This demonstrates how licensed- shared frameworks can produce significant 
new utility in spectrum that may have otherwise remained unused.  
In response , CTIA  points to a measurement study that it undertook, which suggest s that 
the CBRS band is underutilized.
27  However, the design of the CTIA study was faulty .  The

"8 study used drive test s to record the number of channels with a CBRS base station transmission.28  
Drive test s are generally  used to measure the geographic coverage of a traditional macro cell 
network, but CBRS is inherently not a wide -area band with expansive geographic coverage—and 
this is a strong benefit of the band.  T he value of the CBRS band comes from low -power use to 
provide capacity where it is needed (e.g., small cells and private 5G networks).  CTIA’s limited  
drive test , therefore, did not accurately capture CBRS’s public utility and real -world utilization 
because CBRS provides targeted deployment rather than blanket coverage.  To understand 
CTIA’s error, consider applying CTIA’s methodology to the Fixed Service (“FS”) links used to connect cell towers.  CTIA’s methodology would suggest that these high- site, high- gain FS links 
are underutilizing their band because they are not used to cover large geographic areas, but to provide service only where they are needed.  This design flaw provides a useful example of how the Commission should not  undertake measurement .  It was a results -oriented advocacy exerci se 
rather than a well -designed study that accounted for the use characteristics of the band .  
Measurement campaigns should serve to inform the Commission’s policymaking and ensure that scarce spectrum resources are best serving the public—they should not be used as a self -serving 
tool to limit competition.

"9 CONCLUSION 
NCTA commends the Commission for seeking new ways to develop more accurate and 
reliable data on spectrum use.  The record demonstrates that  a one- size- fits-all measurement 
approach would not achieve this goal.  Instead, the Commission should (1) develop a 
measurement approach based on a band’s or spectrum users’ overall public utility and not treat 
received power or channel occupancy as a proxy for utility, and (2) adopt measurement policies and approaches that are neutral with respect to technology and spectrum- use framework —no 
specific technology or framework should be favored.

SATELLITE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION  REPLY COMMENTS  
The Satellite Industry Association (“SIA”)1 hereby addresses comments responding  to the 
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”)  inquiry on non-federal radiofrequency spectrum 
usage.2  Any FCC spectrum occupancy survey  should be careful to differentiate be tween specific 
uses in different frequency band s without prioritiz ing any band s, technologies, services, or 
assignment methods.   Any related  policy change s should appropriate ly consider  each service’s 
purpose and qualitative features , such as the critical importance of satellite services for national 
security and public safety,  rather than  quantitative or efficiency metrics alone .  Such an exercise 
should also enlist non -crowdsourced, vetted, and safeguarded data to advance  well-articulated , 
timely  FCC action .  With this information , the FCC should foster spectrum policies that take a 
holistic approach to overall spectrum usage, competition , customer service quality , and other 
public interest benef its across the  full range of frequenc y bands, technologies , and uses .

"2 I. A ONE -SIZE -FITS -ALL APPROACH IS NOT WORKABLE FOR MEASURING 
SPECTRUM USAGE.  
SIA recommended that the FCC utilize  a service -by-service measurement methodology  to 
assess spectrum occupanc y.3  Multiple parties agree , noting that frequency, time, geography , and 
service  considerations all matter.  Regarding frequency  use, for example, national security radars 
may use their full bandwidth but not some predetermined output threshold  because radars employ 
frequency hopping to avoid jamming and detection.4  Regarding t emporal  use, for example, certain 
public safety services may have low-usage periods  but need sufficient capacity for high -use 
periods and emergencies .5  And r egarding geograp hic use , for example,  mobile service licensees 
have exclusive ly license d areas (some of which may not be fully occupied).6  What also is material 
is service type —including whether it provides for intra - or inter -service sharing, as is the case for 
most satellite services, or sharing  with federal users .  These examples demonstrate that customers ’ 
different service and associated spectrum usage needs  will require separate frequency band and 
service -specific usage studies.   An oversimplified analysis of one or more quantitative measures 
across all spectrum bands without considering these qualitative factors could misrepresent 
spectrum usage and undermine the agency’s goal s. 
Likewise, a ny spectrum usage survey  should not prioritize any frequency  bands  or uses .  
The FCC should reject argument s by few commenters  that any investigation should focus on non -

"3 auctioned services operating under shared and unlicensed frameworks .7  As an initial matter, the 
Commission has recognized that non-auctioned spectrum supports some of the most critical 
services and applications ( e.g., for public safety and national security satellite applications) —and 
that effective  use of this spectrum is essential to safeguarding and promoting the public interest.  
Moreover, while it would be a mistake to prioritize based on “spectral efficiency” in any event, 
the mere fact that spectrum has been acquired through an auction  does not mean  licensees are using 
the spectrum efficiently .8  To the contrary, the fact that spectrum is auctioned typically limit s the 
potential uses of the relevant spectrum  (e.g., for public safety and national security satellite 
purposes) .  Moreover, the FCC has recognized that auction winners may have the ability and the 
incentive to underutilize auctioned spectrum, which is why the FCC  has develop ed policies and 
rules to ensure greater deployment and continued usage of auctioned and non -auctioned wireless 
services in recent years ,9 reflecting that these services should not be exempt  from this examination .  
Further, this position, if adopted,  could limit spectrum uses where the United States plays a 
leadership role, as demonstrated by com menters (including SIA),10 employing spectrum for public 
safety, enterprise, unlicensed, broadcasting, microwave and fixed wireless, radar, and other 
technologies and uses.

uses across multiple bands  by investing billions in expensive technologies under an effective and

demand robust, reliable, and timely satellite  spectrum deployment , and commercial satellite 
spectrum is increasingly relied upon to support federal operations .  The recent SIA Spectrum 
Report confirms th ese conclusion s.  The number of operational satellites, space -based data 
capacity, and Earth observa tion data collections  and downloads have grown and will continue 
increasing exponentially.12  As Chairwoman Rosenworcel recently remarked  at Silicon Valley 
Space Week, the agency has pending applications for more than 56,000 satellites, twice the number 
from four years ago, as well as “new applications for novel space activities like lunar landers, 
space tugs that can deploy other satellites, and space antenna farms that can relay 
communications.”13  This influx  stems from the considerable investme nt throughout the satellite 
industry to transform mobile communications ; broadband connectivity ; internet -of-things  and 
machine -to-machine connectivity;  broadcast ; remote sensing and imaging ; positioning, 
navigation, and timing services;  in-space servicing , assembly, and manufacturing ; and more.

"5 auctioned spectrum are any less used than auctioned spectrum ,14 and any spectrum usage 
examination pursued through this  proceeding should equally explore all bands .15 
Context is important to fully  understand spectrum occupancy .  AT&T supports “the goal 
of more efficient use of the national spectrum resources, [but] what that means and how to achieve 
that goal is contextual .”16  Efficiency is not always the most important factor when evaluating 
whether a particular frequency band is “used.”  Lock heed Martin, therefore, urges the Commission 
to incorporat e the qualitative features of a given service into how spectrum use is measured, as 
opposed to relying solely upon quantitative measures.17  Taken alone, for instance, quantitative 
metrics fail to c onsider the public safety and national security considerations of how certain 
systems use spectrum to meet their defined missions.   SIA encourages further consideration of this 
reframing when attempting to evaluate the extent of  spectrum usage .  
 
14 Contrary to one commenter’s claim, current mobile -satellite service (“MSS”) licensees have 
spent decades and billions of dollars to develop, enhance, and expand coverage.   Any sugg estion 
otherwise is based on parochial concerns, limited to discrete frequencies the commenter  is seeking 
to use, and it would be inappropriate to generalize from these anecdotal examples to the entire 
MSS industry.   See SpaceX, Comments, WT Docket No. 23 -232, at 2 (filed Oct. 3, 2023) (“SpaceX

"6 II. ANY SPECTR UM USAGE DATA COLLECTION SHOULD ENLIST NON -
CROWDSOURCED, VETTED, AND SAFEGUARDED DATA TO AID WELL -
ARTICULATED , TIMELY  FCC ACTION . 
Data hygiene concerns can plague crowdsourced and sens ing data.  While crowdsourced 
data can provide valuable insights in certain contexts, such data can lack sufficient accuracy , 
uniformity, and granularity for many use cases .18  It has the potential to introduce  
“misu nderstandings about the particular usage in specifi c bands ” and “ potential prejudices with 
the sources used .”19  Sens ing data can suffer technological and legitimacy concerns.  Such data 
quality can depend on the antenna efficiency and software defined radio in the desired spectrum 
bands, potential antenna  obstructions in relation to the signal source, installation issues  (such as 
damaged antenna cables ), and sensing operators not inventing  or corrupt ing data for 
reimbursement .20  Given these concerns, SIA recommends that the Commission rely primarily on  
credible public resources in this proceeding, includ ing existing FCC databases, National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration  spectrum usage information, and frequency 
advisory committees.21   
Another key consideration is privacy.  SIA concurs w ith AT&T and CTIA that data 
collections should be narrowly tailored and consistent with past FCC practice by gathering only 
appropriate information  and safeguarding customer data and business competitive  sensitivities.22 
How and when the FCC  uses sanitized, screened spectrum usage data is  critical .  In this

"7 respect, SIA supports the three measurement data principles that NCTA  advances , provided  that 
they are implemented in a way that leaves for consideration of the qualitative factors that SIA 
noted in its initial comments and above .23  Implementing such guideposts ensures spectrum usage 
data is gathered and deployed  only when the FCC needs the data for “ a particular proceeding, 
purpose, or band, rather than adopting any single approach for all its needs. ”24     
III. CONCLUSION . 
Tailor ed FCC examination of high -fidelity and safeguarded spectrum occupancy data will 
foster better understanding of all non-federal spectrum usage  while helping support well -
articulated spectrum policy decision -making that rewards American consumers .  SIA looks 
forward to advancing this discussion , especially regarding how to develop meaningful  and reliable  
spectrum usage survey s and poli cymaking .

 WISPA  – Broadband Without Boundaries  hereby submits these reply comments in 
response to initial Comments submitted on the Notice of Inquiry (“ NOI”) in the above -captioned 
proceeding.1  
Discussion  
I. WISPA AGREES THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD DISTINGUISH 
BETWEEN SPECTRUM THAT IS “OCCUPIED” AND “FULLY OCCUPIED”  
Several commenters noted that a channel may not seem occupied because the spectrum is 
quiet for passive use, or the spectrum is reserved for critical emergency situations that may arise 
without warning.  Notably, t he National Academy of Sciences ’ Committee on Radio Frequencies 
(“CORF”) explain ed that the “NTIA and ITU definitions are likely not useful in addressing 
passive scientific usage of the spectrum.”2  The Alarm Industry Communicat ions Committee 
(“AICC”) also advised that the “Commission must be mindful of special considerations 
regarding public safety, central station alarm and critical infrastructure spectrum needs and

 recognize that there cannot be a one -size-fits-all approach to  measuring spectrum usage .”3  The 
National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (“NPSTC”) cautioned against adopting a 
single metric for evaluating spectrum usage because public safety and other critical systems 
design their systems to “include s uffic ient spectrum capacity to accommodate a surge in 
communications traffic that occurs during an unplanned incident or even a major planned 
event. ”4  Other commenters, such as the County of Los Angeles, California, Lockheed Martin  
Corporation , and the Sate llite Industry Association (“SIA”)  also assert ed that there should be 
different definitions of spectrum usage and that measuring spectrum usage solely as a function of 
how often the output exceeds a certain threshold over a given duration may not be appropri ate 
for all spectrum bands.5 
WISPA agrees that spectrum , which  may not seem to be utilized , may actually be fully 
occupied because it cannot accommodate additional users.  In its Comments, WISPA 
recommended that the Commission define “spectrum usage” by distinguishing between bands 
that are “occupied” and may be able to tolerate additional users, and those that are “fully 
occupied” and cannot accommodate additional users because additional usage would be 
“significantly detrimental to existing us ers.”6  WISPA explained that a band may not be fully 
occupied if a user is occupying only a portion of the band, is operating in a small geographic area

 within its licensed area (such as within the densely populated urban areas with little or no usage 
in sparsely populated rural areas), or only uses the spectrum during certain times.7  
II. THE COMMISSION ’S REVIEW  SHOULD NOT IGNORE AUCTIONED 
SPECTRUM  LICENSED ON AN EXCLUSIVE -USE BASIS  
The record overwhelmingly supports the Commission’s goal s of advancing its 
understanding of non -Federal spectrum usage8 and accurately defining the extent to which a set 
of frequencies is being utilized.9  Certain parties , however, perhaps out of fear that the 
Commission may determine their spectrum bands are not fully occupied and could become 
subject to spectrum sharing  or a change in the future allocation of spectrum , urge the  
Commission to avoid evaluating the usage  of their spectrum bands.   Rather than finding new 
opportunities to facilitate more efficient spectrum use and enable co -existence among users and 
services, these commenters argue that the Commission should not even evaluate whether bands 
licensed through auction for exclusive use ar e being fully utilized and suggest the Commission 
should instead engage in a more limited evaluation of only certain spectrum bands .   
CTIA asserts that mobile spectrum license holders have demonstrated that they already 
have enough market incentives to ma ke efficient use of their spectrum and, therefore, there is no 
need for the Commission to evaluate whether their spectrum is unused or underutilized.10  AT&T 
similarly implies that exclusive licensing and flexible use polices for mobile broadband services,  
combined with market incentives to invest means that the Commission does not need to examine

 the spectrum efficiency of bands held by mobile carriers.11  Verizon also argues that “[g]iven 
these incentives and efforts, the Commission should recognize that the commercial wireless 
licensing model generates tremendous spectrum usage and efficiencies.”12 
The Commission should emphatically reject these arguments.  Unless the Commission 
engages in a comprehensive evaluation of the usage of all non -Federal spectru m bands, the study 
will be of limited use and will not serve the Commission’s goal to obtain more detailed and 
sophisticated knowledge of non -Federal spectrum usage.   
 WISPA disagrees with the fundamental premise that maximum efficiency is already 
“built in” to spectrum bands that are licensed for exclusive use, subject to current secondary 
market policies, and used to provide service in a competitive market.13  In its Comments, WISPA  
stated that “[c]urrent spectrum policies and buildout rules often do not  adequately consider the 
extent of spectrum usage, instead allowing spectrum to be warehoused or lie fallow.  A study of 
spectrum utilization can therefore provide valuable insights into how and w here spectrum can be 
more efficiently utilized and how and w here more spectrum can be made available to users 
where it is currently underutilized.”14  The Commission should not assume that all spectrum that 
has been auctioned for exclusive use is automatically being fully utilized.   Competition , the costs 
of acquir ing and deploying licensed spectrum in some areas and a lack of incentive to use 
spectrum in certain high-cost areas can all serve as reasons why a licensee  may not fully use 
licensed spectrum.   WISPA agrees with the Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating

 Council, Inc. (“AFTRCC”) that “ exclusive -use licensees, for example, seeking access to new 
spectrum bands cannot simply be presumed to have sufficiently maximized use of spectrum 
already allocated and author ized, particularly over all geographies and frequencies and times. ”15 
In fact, the record developed by the Commission in other proceedings demonstrate s that 
auctioning  spectrum in large geographic areas often leads to service in urban and suburban areas 
but large amounts of fallow spectrum in rural areas.   When the Commission was considering 
changes to its secondary market rules, WISPA explained  that “large companies may never 
launch service in less lucrative significant portions of their licensed markets.   In effect, licensed 
spectrum is in some cases treated as a financial asset for market valuation purposes, but not as a 
resource for deploying service to rural areas where the financial return may be many years in the 
future. ”16  Instead, larger carriers “ serve the urban ‘holes ’ and leave the rural ‘donuts ’ unserved 
because of the lower population density and corresponding higher per -customer deployment cost.  
Because current rules do not appropriately encourage buildout to these areas, valuable spectrum 
is kept away from smaller service providers who would have both the incentive and the 
capability to deploy in the remote and unserved ‘donuts. ’”17 
WISPA reiterates that it is “vital to take urban, suburban, and rural areas into account 
when evaluating usage. ”18  The Commission should not assume that use of a channel within a 
licensee’s band in its licensed area or that serving a certain percentage of the population 
constitutes full occupancy of the spectrum.  While the Commission has taken some steps to

 impro ve the secondary market to facilitate the leasing of spectrum in unserved and underserved 
areas, the full potential of the secondary market has not yet been realized and is still of limited 
use to many potential providers.  There is no reason why the Commi ssion should not study 
auctioned spectrum bands to gain a better understanding of spectrum usage  to inform its policy 
decisions going forward . 
WISPA strenuously disputes CTIA’s assertion that licensing models where spectrum is 
shared or unlicensed do not create the same incentives for providers to innovate, invest, and 
make intensive and efficient use of spectrum.19  WISPA has observ ed that “fixed wireless 
providers frequently use unlicensed, shared, and exclusive -use spectrum at low -band, mid -band, 
and high -band frequencies, predominantly in rural, unserved, and underserved areas.”20  WISPA 
also explained that its members “h ave deployed affordable and reliable broadb and service with 
innovative and evolving fixed wireless technology  . . . in rural areas that have not historically 
been cost -efficient for larger companies  to deploy wireline plant .”21  WISPA’s members “have 
continually upgraded their networks with new tec hnology and when available, new spectrum 
allocations to meet consumer demand and have successfully responded to the dramatic rise in 
bandwidth consumption during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic .”22 
 
19 CTIA Comments at 3 (“By contrast, other licensing or spectrum access models lack these market 
incentives. Under licensing models where spectrum is shared (such as satellite, CBRS, etc.), granted by 
rule or unlicensed, stakeholders do not have the same mec hanisms or incentives to ensure that unused or 
underutilized spectrum is refarmed and thus transferred to use cases with higher valuation and greater 
spectral efficiency.”)

"7 
 Thus, there can be no dispute that shared and unlicensed  spectrum models provide 
significant incentives to fixed wireless service providers to  deploy efficient and affordable 
broadband service and that such unlicensed and shared spectrum  bands generate significant value 
to the public, especially in rural unserve d and underserved areas whe re there are no other 
terrestrial sources of affordable fixed broadband access.   The Commission should reject the 
suggestion made by CTIA, and echoed by large carriers, that the Commission “should focus on 
spectrum bands  . . . such as shared/unlicensed spectrum bands and bands where licensing is done 
outside of competitive bidding.”23  The Commission should not reward mobile carriers while 
they hold large amounts of unused spectrum outside of metropolitan areas.    
III. THE VALUE OF SPECTRUM IS NOT DETERMINED SOLELY BY PRICES 
PAID AT AUCTION  
 
While the Commission does not seek comment on the economic or social value created 
by operators’ spectrum -based services,24 certain commenters suggest that the money  spent on 
acquiring licenses at auction should be a primary factor in the Commission’s analysis of 
spectrum usage. 25  WISPA strongly disagrees that the economic and public interest value of 
spectrum can be express ed solely in terms of the price paid to acquire licensed spectrum  via 
auction .26  In fact, Congress recognized this when it enacted Section 309(j) (7)(A)  of the 
 
23 CTIA Comments at 2; Verizon Comments at 6 (“The Commission should also focus  any investigation  
on non-auctioned spectrum bands, such as unlicensed, shared uses, and satellite, given they do not have 
the same incentives that are inherent to spectrum assigned via the auction licensing model .”) 
24 NOI at 2 (¶ 3). 
25 See, e.g., Verizon Comments at 4 ( “Acquiring commercial wireless licenses at auction or in the 
secondary market comes with a multi -billion -dollar price tag  . . .” and therefore achieves the most 
efficient use of spectrum. ). 
26 See, e.g., Comments of Randall Berry, John A. Dever, Thomas Ha zlett, and Michael Honig , WT 
Docket No. 23 -232 (filed Oct. 3, 2023) , at 4-5 (discussing that the value of spectrum for flexible -use",6,WISPA Reply Comments Non-Federal Spectrum Use (23-232).pdf,WISPA – BROADBAND  WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 
 Communications Act  of 1934 , as amended, and instructed the Commission that, when 
establishing  spectrum block sizes and geographic areas to be sold at spectrum auctions,  it should 
“not base a finding of public interest, convenience, and necessity on the expectation of Federal 
revenues from the use of a system of competitive bidding under this subsecti on.”27  In other 
words, Congress determine d that the Commission should design its spectrum auctions to meet 
public interest goals of innovation , competition,  and economic development of rural 
communities that would not always result in the largest  winning bids for commercial wireless 
spectrum.   Therefore, irrespective of how much money a bidder spends to acquire its exclusive -
use license, the Commission should carefully examine how a commercial wireless compan y is 
deploying its licenses .  If it determines exclusive use licensed spectrum  is not bei ng deployed in 
a manner that best serves the public interest, then the Commission  should take steps to ensure 
that spectrum is made available to other companies, whether through opportunistic use or the 
secondary market so that  use of that spectrum  can best promote bridging digital divides, 
competition, innovation, investment, and economic dev elopment.   
It is also important to consider that the traditional method of paying high fees to acquire 
exclusive -use spectrum over large geographic areas also exclu des smaller operators and 
increases the price for services provided by the handful of large operators that can afford 
acquiring those licenses for wireless spectrum .  In addition, t he valuation of spectrum should not 
be made on the basis of  revenues that the federal government receives from spectrum  auction s 
alone as that grossly underestimates t he value of unlicensed spectrum.  A large industry has 
 
licenses is “revealed by auction prices, which can be used to directly compare the value of spectrum 
across different locati ons (e.g., urban versus rural) and bands (midband versus millimeter wave.”).

 developed around providing Wi -Fi equipment , for example, which “is now the most commonly 
used medium for the last hop of most mass -market broadband Internet access arrangements.”28   
Auctioning spectru m is a method to allocate access among potential providers of 
spectrum -based services, and the very nature of a  spectrum  auction usually means that the 
wealthiest commercial wireless companies will end up placing the highest winning bids for that 
spectrum.   But that auction process does not always determine the “highest or best use” of the 
spectrum  where  the winning bidders do not deploy commercial wireless services using th at 
spectrum throughout the license d geographic area.  The Commission should also consider that 
the usage of certain spectrum bands , such as CBRS, is still growing as usage models are still 
being developed, so it may be difficult to value such bands largely based on recent auctions  such 
as Auction 105 for CBRS  Priority Access Licenses.  
IV. A NATIONWIDE NON -EXCLUSIVE LICENSING MODEL CAN BE USED 
FOR ADDITIONAL BANDS AND CAN BE USED TO COORDINATE WITH 
SATELLITE SERVICES  
WISPA agrees with Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (“SpaceX”) that a nationwide, 
non-exclusive licensing approach can be u sed for additional spectrum bands and that it can be 
used to coordinate spectrum sharing with satellite services.29  SpaceX explains that such a  light-
licensing framework for fixed service links in the 70/80/90 GHz band is based on a “nationwide, 
non-exclu sive license with a requirement to register individual fixed service links in a shared 
third -party database.”30  WISPA concurs with SpaceX that implementing a unified database for 
other spectrum bands “not only would provide a cost-effective, accurate, scalable , and actionable

 means of assessing spectrum usage on near real -time basis, they also would simplify licensing, 
speed coordination, and promote rapid deployment of innovative services.31 
Conclusion  
 For the reasons set forth above, WISPA supports the Commission’s efforts to define and 
review non -federal spectrum usage.  WISPA agrees that there is no one -size-fits-all approach and 
recommends that  the Commission  define “spectrum usage” by distinguishing between bands that 
are “occupied” and may be able to tolerate additional users, and those that are “fully  occupied” 
and cannot accommodate additional users .  The Commission should take unlicensed spectrum 
into account and should analyze all licensed spectrum bands, including spectrum auctioned for 
exclusive use .

Summary  
The Association of Federal Communications Consulting Engineers ( AFCCE )1 submits  this reply 
to comments  of the Notice of Inquiry  in the above -referenced  proceeding. AFCCE agrees with the 
vast majority of commenters , who  support the Commission’s inquiry into obtaining more 
knowledge of non- Federal spectrum. The comments widely agree that new methods must be 
employed to  advance the Commission’s  management of the spectrum resource for the  benefit of 
the public and future users.  
 
Background 
AFCCE recognizes multiple reasons why the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should 
gather real -time data on spectrum usage:  
 
1 AFCCE is a professional organization composed of members who provide technical, legal and other supporting roles 
in the communications industry to serve clients having matters under the purview of the Commission, including a 
significant number of members who are registered/licensed professional engineers.  AFCCE has worked together with 
the FCC for over 60 years to provide comments, guidance, and recommendations on such topics a s matters of rule 
interpretation, technical collaboration, and assessing impact of FCC policy and implementation suggestions.",0,20231102 AFCCE Reply WTB Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

• To better understand how spectrum is being used. The FCC can use real -time data to 
identify areas where spectrum is underutilized or overutilized, and to track how spectrum 
usage varies in the short term and changes over longer time  frames. This information can 
help the FCC to develop more efficient spectrum management policies and to support the development of new technologies and services that rely on spectrum.  
• To identify geographic areas where spectrum is underutilized or overutilized. Real -time 
data can help the FCC to identify areas where spectrum is not being used efficiently. This information can be used to develop policies that promote spectrum sharing and to facilitate the depl oyment of new spectrum -intensive services.  
• To develop more efficient spectrum management policies. Real -time data can help the FCC 
to develop spectrum management policies that are more responsive to the changing needs of users. For example, the FCC could use real -time data to dynamically adjust spe ctrum 
usage limits or to identify new opportunities for spectrum sharing.  
• To support the development of new technologies and services that rely on spectrum. Real -
time data can help identify and support the development of new technologies and services 
that rely on spectrum. For example, the FCC could use real -time data to identify areas 
where there is a high demand for spectrum from new technologies, and where spectrum allocated for new technologies is not utilized to the extent anticipated, such as next -
generation wireless services (e.g., nascent 5G deployments) .

"® 
The Commission presently tracks spectrum usage through its allocations and licensing activities, 
recogniz ing that its various databases  provide limited real -time data on actual spectrum utilization. 
These “snapshot -in-time” databases, the Commission notes, need  techniques for active real -time 
collection of actual spectrum utilization to efficiently manage the growing demand for spectrum.  
Given that nearly all the Commenters agreed with th is requirement , little needs to be added by 
AFCCE to those recommendations.  However, AFCCE wishes to encourage the Commission’s 
consideration of established government programs and non- profit research organizations that are 
already gathering spectrum usage data of types that would fulfill the need for ongoing real -time 
spectrum usage data.  
 
FCC Approach to Developing Studies and Collecting Information  
The Commission, in its Notice  specifically cited the National  Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) directive to  “design and conduct a pilot program to monitor  
spectrum usage in real time.” The NTIA, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) established a Spectrum Monitoring Pilot Program that gather s real-time data on spectrum 
usage .   These organizations, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) should join with the 
FCC:  
• To leverage the expertise of these organizations in spectrum measurement and analysis. 
NIST, NSF, and NTIA have extensive expertise in the development and deployment of 
spectrum measurement and analysis technologies. Working with these organizations would allow the FCC to leverage this expertise to gather real- time data on spectrum usage in a 
more efficient and effective manner.  
• To promote innovation in spectrum measurement and analysis technologies. By working with NIST, NSF, and NTIA, the FCC can help to promote the development of new and innovative spectrum measurement and analysis technologies. This would allow the FCC to",2,20231102 AFCCE Reply WTB Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"® 
gather more comprehensive and accurate data on spectrum usage, and to do so in a more 
cost-effective manner.  
• To ensure that the data is collected in a neutral and objective manner. NIST, NSF, and NTIA are all government organizations that are independent of any particular industry or interest group. This makes them well -suited to collect and analyze data on spect rum usage 
in a neutral and objective manner.  
• To develop spectrum information -processing protocols that generate useful metrics of 
spectrum usage and differentiate usage from occupancy.  
 While the NIST, NSF, and NTIA  did not file in response to the Commission’s Notice , there are 
many compelling reasons for the FCC to work more closely with these organizations to gather 
real-time data on spectrum usage. By doing so, the FCC can better understand how spectrum is 
being used, develop more efficient spectrum management policies, support the development of new technologies and services, and protect consumers from har mful interference.  
 AFCCE notes that two commenters, SpectrumX and Open Research Institute, Inc  have significant 
experience in designing, building and deploying measurement hardware and sensor networks.   
Working from the start with academic non -profit organizations provides the Commission with 
opportunities for more cost -effective and objective monitoring network development .",3,20231102 AFCCE Reply WTB Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

REPLY COMMENTS OF AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES, INC.  
Aviation Spectrum Resources, Inc. , (“ASRI ”) hereby provides its reply comments in the 
Commission’s inquiry regarding non -Federal spectrum usage.1  ASRI  submits that assessments 
of spectrum usage must be band -specific while at the same time considering together all relevant 
bands and their existing and proposed uses.  ASRI suggests that the Commission should be 
particularly mindful of mission critical use s for safety , such as a vast majority of aviation 
Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance  (“CNS ”) functions, where access to spectrum 
over a wide variety of use cases and patterns must be available when and where needed  under 
any and all conditions .  ASRI supports the early engagement of multi -stakeholder processes as a 
primary means of avoiding , as well as resolving , disputes concerning spectrum usage in relevant 
bands and supporting data-driven spectrum management decision making.

"2 Aeronautical Frequency Committee (“AFC”), a representative aviation in dustry committee that 
develops and recommends policy regarding international and domestic aviation spectrum.2 
Aviation in the United States relies on multiple CNS functions supported by  various non -
Federal and Federal systems operating in spectrum allocations as low as  130 kHz and as high as 
77 GHz; new CNS systems are considering operations in the 90  GHz  range .3  The International 
Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) Handbook on Radio Frequency Spectrum Requirements 
for Civil Aviation  lists over tw enty independent allocated frequency bands that can operate 
simultaneously on one aircraft, and this does not cover a multitude of additional satellite and 
ground systems that also support aviation operations.4  Many of these bands are designated for 
radio navigation services or other safety services, which are entitled to protection from harmful 
interference at a higher level than non-safety services to ensure the safety of human life and 
property.5  To maintain the safety and efficiency of America’s aviati on systems, aeronautical  
bands must be available when and where needed.  Thus, as a practical matter, these bands require

"3 continuous availability and , from a regulatory perspective, should be considered fully utilized  by 
the aviation systems they support.  
ASRI is pleased to take this opportunity to reply to some of the comments submitted in 
response to the Notice .  ASRI concurs in the objective of identifying ways to improve the 
Commission’s understanding of spectrum usage by the many types of users that benefit from 
spectrum access today.  ASRI is confident that such data will aid the  agency’s future spectrum 
management decision -making  and lead  to more balanced results in the public interest .  ASRI 
urges the Commission, to the extent it examines  non-Federal bands supporting aviation CNS 
functions, to consider  the specialized purposes for which these allocations have been made to 
support critical aspects of our nation’s  complex , extremely safe , and successful  air transport 
system.  
DISCUSSION  
1. No Spectrum Bands Should Be Categorically Excluded from an Examination of 
Spectrum Usage , but Different Bands Require Different Approaches    
 
The Notice  appropriately does not suggest that any spectrum bands, by their nature , are 
exempt from Commission inquiry as to how and the extent to which they are being utilized.  The 
Notice  asks how best to “appropriately capture the extent to which a set of frequencies is being 
utilized,”6 while acknowledging that there are special cons iderations for certain needs, such as 
public safety,7 and some spectrum “bands may exhibit infrequent usage that are nonetheless 
mission critical for their intended uses.”8   
ASRI believes efforts to better understand spectrum utilization should be suffici ently 
comprehensive to encompass all spectrum bands relative to questions that come before the

"4 Commission.  ASRI strongly disagrees with those commenters that urge the Commission to 
focus such efforts only on frequency bands that are not exclusively licensed through competitive 
bidding.9  No band should be off limits (even if assigned through exclusive auctions) if the FCC 
wants actionable  data to better inform its spectrum management decisions .  As the 
radiofrequency spectrum becomes increasingly cro wded, non-Federal licensees  seeking access to 
additional spectrum bands should be expected to offer evidence of the extent to which they are 
currently maximizing spectrum usage  in their existing assignments .  The existence of economic 
incentives to use spe ctrum efficiently at the time it was assigned does not guarantee a band is , in 
fact, being efficiently or optimally used  when licensee s in that band seek access to additional 
spectrum .  The Commission should not simply assume that assignment of spectrum th rough 
competitive bidding automatically means it  is being utilized fully  and efficiently.  For example, 
the recent Commission inquiries about the apparent lack of deployment in spectrum that DISH 
was awarded through competitive bidding proves  that any economic incentive s arising from  
paying for spectrum does not obviate the value in critically examining the extent to which 
exclusively licensed spectrum has been put to efficient use .10  Other metrics, such as frequency 
reuse and tower location optimizati on, are a much better way of measuring efficiency of 
commercial wireless spectrum usage.   
ASRI is pleased that the Commission recognizes that “[t]here is not a one -size-fits all 
approach to measuring spectrum usage ,”11 and virtually all commenters reiterat e this assessment.

"5 ASRI concurs with the many commenters that urge the Commission to consider that different 
types of spectrum uses are not susceptible to a uniform approach to spectrum usage 
measurement , especially one  that may be appropriate for geographic coverage -type commercial 
services, such as spectrum monitoring at representative locations using a spectrum analyzer .12  
The Commission should approach spectrum usage measurements in each specific case after 
developing  an adequate understanding how the relevant bands are being used b y different 
relevant services.13   
2. The Mission Critical Needs of Aviation Safety Bands Require Continuous 
Availability  
 
Each non-Federal aviation band is typically  dedicated to one or, in a few cases, more 
specialized use cases to support flight and aviation operations, such as different types of 
specialized voice and data links  with air traffic control , different types of radionavigation and 
radiolocation systems, position , navi gation and timing systems, and satellite communications.  In 
virtually all cases, aviation u sage of aeronautical safety bands  requires that the spectrum be 
available when needed , and there are not alternate bands in most cases for the types of CNS 
operations in question .  Moreover, aviation stakeholders  coordinate their use of the band in ways 
to maximize the effective capacity to meet the needs of large numbers of aircraft operations  in a 
controlled interference environment .  The fact that there ar e not alternative bands for most 
                                                      
12  See, e.g.,  Comments of National Public Safety Telecommunications Council (“ NPSTC ”) at 
5, 6; Comments of Alarm Industry Communications Committee  (“AICC”)  at 1, 4; Comments of 
the GPS Innovation Alliance  (“GPSIA”)  at 8; Comments of National Academy of Sciences, 
through its Committee on Radio Frequencies  at 9; Comments of Enterprise Wirele ss Alliance  
(“EWA”)  at 3-4; Comments of WISPA – Broadband Without Boundaries  at 5; Comments of 
Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc.  (“AFTRCC”) , at 18.  
13 Accord, e.g., Comments of NPSTC at 4 (“any assessment must be based first on how spectrum 
is used before it attempts to determine how much  it is being used” (emphasis in original))",4,ASRI Reply 23 232 Nov 2 2023.pdf,AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"6 existing aeronautical services and infrequent efforts to find new bands for those services, creates 
a strong incentive for aviation equipment manufacturers and operators to use their spectrum 
efficiently.14     
For these rea sons and given the importance  of the spectrum uses to the United States’ 
world leading air transport system, the aeronautical bands should be  treated as fully utilized 
when considering candidate bands to study for  possible introduction of new, non -aeronaut ical 
systems.15  Techniques that measure  band occupancy  in representative locations to generate 
actionable data , such as  through straightforward monitoring of signals at representative locations 
and their duration and power over time , or some variation thereof,  do not make sense in the 
aeronautical bands  given their purpose and how they are used  and must remain continually ready 
for use .16  These bands are  not susceptible to strict scheduling or predictive models to render 
them suitable for sharing with non-aeronautical uses through techniques such as artificial 
intelligence.  Usage of aviation safety frequencies can often be very unpredictable and uneven , 
even over short time frames.  Rapid variation in usage can result, for example, during air 
emergencie s or sudden traffic and flight schedule changes due to weather patterns , mechanical 
                                                      
14 In the last decade, the aviation industry has undertaken to repurpose aeronautical allocations 
without affecting other spectrum users, including AeroMACS  and, separately, Uncrewed 
Aircraft Systems in different segments of the previous microwave landing systems band of 5030 -
5150 MHz; the L -band Digital Aeronautical Communications System in the 960 -1164 MHz 
band; and Wireless Aircraft Intra Communications in  the 4200 -4400 MHz band.  
15  See also  Comments of NPSTC at 6 (arguing that pu blic safety bands are in effect  fully 
utilized because they must be available when needed by public safety users).  
16  At the same time, ASRI acknowledges that how intensely aeronautical bands are used for 
their existing purposes may be relevant to the aviation industry, the FAA, and the Commission 
when considering band options in which to introduce new aeronautical services.  Understanding 
the spectrum usage of the aeronautical incumbents and how the new or additional uses would 
function in these bands allows for successful transitions to introduce new uses.",5,ASRI Reply 23 232 Nov 2 2023.pdf,AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7 problems,  and cancellations occurring in the normal course.17  The unpredictability of aviation 
operations underscores the need that adequate  aeronautical spectrum be always  available  to adapt 
and accommodate the needs of aviation operations.  This unpredictability is the reason that 
measuring usage through straightforward monitoring techniques is not going to yield “actionable 
data,” in terms of identifying possible additional, non -aeronautical  uses into the aviation bands  
supporting CNS functions . 
3. Measuring In -Band Spectrum Usage Should Not Be Confused with Co -Existence 
Issues in Adjacent Bands  
 
In pursuing usage information  for specific bands , the Commission  should also have a 
clear vision of the relevant issues  and not be misled by externalities which should be addressed 
through different technical analysis and policy determinations .  Thus, AT&T’s proffered  
criticism in its comments of the sensitivity of aviation ra dio altimeter  receiver s in the 4.2 -4.4 
GHz band to passband interference from high -powered commercial mobile service transmitters 
operating below 4.2 GHz18 is irrelevant to the question how , and the extent to which,  the safety -
of-life radio altimeter band is being utilized .  Within the 4.2 -4.4 GHz, aircraft that rely on radio 
altimeters must be able to rely around the clock on the interference -free availability of these 200 
megahertz.19  To the extent improvements in receiver sensitivity  renders these  critical aviation 
                                                      
17  In terms of the spectrum assignments to aviation users that ASRI manages in the VHF band 
where it is li censed, ASRI does use metrics to identify usage of frequencies and justify assigning 
channels, reassigning channels, or keeping channel assignments.  For example, aircraf t voice 
contact report s or airport landing/takeoff traffic data provide metrics for certain aviation 
functions .  Additionally , sometimes coverage is a key requirement  that dictates usage , such as 
coverage for each airport gate for ramp control functions or enroute airspace sectors .  These 
requirements  impact  the assessment of usage and de termin e whether other aeronautical uses can 
be introduced or reassignments made.   
18  See Comments of AT&T at 4-5. 
19  ASRI notes that , flatly contradictory  to their complaints about the spectral efficiency  of 
certain receivers , proponents for a commercial flexible use allocation  in the 3.7 -3.98 MHz band 
pushed for and secured higher spurious emissions levels  outside of the flexible use allocation,",6,ASRI Reply 23 232 Nov 2 2023.pdf,AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 system s less vulnerable to interference from its high -powered neighbors, and thereby promotes 
near-adjacent -band coexistence, that does not change the requirement for mission and safety 
critical when ever-needed access to an d use of the 4.2-4.4 GHz  band during approaches and 
landings and other aviation operations.  
4. The Commission Should Utilize  Balanced Multi -Stakeholder Processes When 
Seeking  Spectrum Usage Data  
 
Generally, ASRI agrees with those commenters that more knowled ge about how bands 
are being used , beyond  solely the extent  to which they are being used , will help the Commission 
make better spectrum management decisions.20  While supporting this notion in general, NCTA  
contends that  the Commission should ensure that efforts to obtain better spectrum usage data 
                                                      
and, indeed,  more than 200 megahertz above that allocation  falling directly into the safety -of-
life radar altimeter band .  See In the Matter of Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz  
Band , Report and Order and Order of Proposed Modification , FCC 20 -22, GN Docket No. 18 -
122, ¶¶ 343-344 (rel. Mar. 3, 2020) (s ubsequent history  omitted).  The spurious emissions  levels 
proposed and supported  at -13 dBm/MHz conducted were the least stringent of the 3GPP 
specifications for the 5G equipment available .  Cat B base stations for the same equipment and 
band could have b een promoted  instead at -30 dBm/MHz to make such spectrum usage more 
efficient .  Unfortunately , the decision to set the less stringent spurious emission value is  now 
creating additional issues for radar altimeter manufacturers in designing new sys tems against 
such spectrally inefficient  signals, resulting in added  complications for aviation equipment 
manufacturers rather than being addressed by the interfering flexible  use licensees.  Clearly, 
assigning exclusive licenses  through competitive bidding in the neighborhood of safety services 
inherently creates no economic incentives for an exclusive licensee to make efforts “to stay  in its 
lane.”   
20  See, e.g., Comments of GPSIA at 2 (beyond mere data collection, “the Commiss ion [must] 
consider the varying service, operational, and technical  characteristics of how spectrum is used 
to obtain an accurate picture and develop appropriate  policies ”); Comments of AICC at 1(while 
supporting the inquiry and policy goals of maximizing spectrum usage, “the Commission must 
be mindful of special considerations regarding public safety, central station alarm and critical 
infrastructure spectrum needs and recognize that there cannot be a one -size-fits-all approach to 
measuring spectrum usage” ); Comments of Lockheed Martin Corporation at 4 (“ quantitative data 
alone do not reveal whether spectrum is maximally used”; rather “the qualitative features of a 
given service should also factor into how spectrum use is measured;” “exclusive reliance upon  
quantitative metrics would entirely bypass the public safety and national security considerations 
of how such critical systems use spectrum to meet their defined missions.”); Comments of 
AFTRCC at 2; Comments of  EWA  at 1.",7,ASRI Reply 23 232 Nov 2 2023.pdf,AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 should not be a vehicle for delays in allocation decision s.21  This guideline  is agreeable to ASRI 
in principle , but the propriety of its relevance depends on the circumstances .   
Some uses are not susceptible to a straightforward measurement of band occupancy or 
“representative sampling” to understand the extent to which the Commission should or should 
not consider the band utilized in making spectrum management decisions .  Efforts to obtain 
sound spectrum utilization  data in such use cases is likely to be more complex.  In other cases, 
controversies may develop over whether proponents of access to new spectrum bands are 
effectively seeking to warehouse spectrum for competitive o r strategic purposes or have a real 
need to access additional spectrum as a necessary means of accommodating growth in demand.  
In short, d isputes in good faith among stakeholders as to the best way to assess spectrum usage in 
specific situations are bound  to occur.  The Commission may have to ultimately resolve those 
disputes if the interested parties are unable to, but ASRI submits that the Commission should 
encourage a resolution through collaboration in a reasonably timely manner whenever possible, 
even  if the collaborative efforts may take some time in especially thorny cases.  Promoting multi -
stakeholder processes early in the decision -making processes ( e.g., rulemakings) holds the 
promise of minimizing disputes over usage data, and such processes  shou ld be strongly 
encouraged.  Indeed, ASRI firmly believes that these types of multi -stakeholder exercise s must 
occur in advance of, and continue through the duration of,  major proceedings if the Commission  
is going to be serious about data -driven spectrum m anagement decision -making.  
 CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, ASRI submits that assessments of spectrum usage must be 
band -specific while at the same time considering together all relevant bands and their existing

"10 and proposed uses .  Most commenters recognize that utilization of spectrum within various 
allocations may differ depending on the respective uses  and purposes to which the spectrum is 
being put .  The Commission should be particularly mindful of mission critical uses, such as a 
vast majority of aviation CNS functions, where access to spectrum over a wide variety of use 
cases and patterns must be available when and where needed.  Assessing spectrum usage can be 
complex ;  ASRI supports the early engagement of multi -stakeholder  processes as a primary 
means of avoiding , as well as resolving , disputes concerning spectrum usage in relevant bands 
and supporting data-driven spectrum management decision -making.  ASRI looks forward to 
continuing  work with the Commission, the Executive Branch agencies, and industry participants 
to advance the understanding of how the radiofrequency spectrum is being used  and how it can 
be put to even better use  while protecting the critical, multifaceted needs of aviation operations .

I. Introduction  
Shure Incorporated (“Shure”) welcomes the Commission’s initiation of discussion s to 
better understand non -Federal spectrum utilization and find new ways to use and share spectrum 
in an efficient manner. As proposed by the Notice Of Inquiry (NOI), Advancing Understanding 
of Non -Federal Spectrum Usage1, what is needed is  a broad and generally applicable definition 
of spectrum usage including not only the three discrete components ; geographic usage, 
frequency usage, and time usage  but also RF waveform specific parameters, and the service 
specific Key Performance Indicators, such as reliability, peak user data rate, average user data 
rate, latency, user density, and coverage . 
After establishing this clear definition of spectrum usage, a method to explore the 
efficiency of spectrum usage can be derived from it , including mechanisms to measure, moni tor, 
and analyze both the usage and its efficiency. This ensures that a well -defined metric of all

"2 
 parameters and data needed for analyzing spectrum usage is in place before the discussion on 
how to collect them has started. A measurement without knowledge  of the quantity to be 
measured is usually relatively worthless.  
 
II. Defining Spectrum Usage  
As the Satellite Industry Association (SIA)2, the Society of Broadcast Engineers (SBE)3, 
the Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC)4, the GPS Innovation 
Alliance (GPSIA)5, and AT&T Services6 commented , there is not a “one -size-fits-all” approach 
to measuring spectrum usage due to the variety of different services and wireless technologies . 
Shure strongly supports this statement. Spectrum usage measurement is a complex topic and 
needs more effort than measuring only “the percentage of frequencies or channels in the band 
with detected signal level that exceeds a “default or user -defined thres hold”7 and, like SBE 
mentioned8, before a measurement procedure can be worked out , a definition of spectrum usage 
is needed. The definition may be straightforward if only one service based on one wireless 
technology is deployed nationwide in a given freq uency band, but for local, temporary, and 
nomadic applications with individual wireless technologies this might be not the case. Therefore,

 unauthorized use, just to name some of the most common types of spectrum occupancy”9 is fully 
in line with Shure. In addition to the different types of spectrum occupancy, different wireless 
technologies are used, each with different technical characteristics and requirements. Using only 
a default threshold to determine whether a spectrum is occupied or not, could prove problematic 
because depending on the technology used the value of the minimum required Signal -to-Noise 
Ratio at receiver side will vary from the two -digit negative dB range to the two -digit positive dB 
range.  
Here, the ITU defi nition of spectrum occupancy as “the probability that, at a randomly 
selected moment in time, a radio channel, frequency band or other frequency resource being 
analyzed will be in use for the transmission of information”10 might be the better approach, but 
the probability is given as a function of observation time and occupation time whose correlation 
is in most of the cases unknown leading to a resulting range for the probability between 0 and 1 
for one specific service bu t for different observation times. Therefore, even for a huge number of 
repetitions of the randomly selected observation time , the resulting probability could be 
completely wrong and so is not useful to give a reliable metric.  
Since neither definition seem s to solve the problem of defining spectrum usage in a 
meaningful way, Shure shares the opinion of SBE that it is necessary to find a broad definition 
that “incorporates a number of technical details and subcategories ”11. The NOI’s suggestion to 
break spec trum usage into discrete components like geographic usage, frequency usage and time 
usage, and to incorporate additional radio frequency engineering metrics, is a good place to start 
in this effort. Even this type of categorization “may not effectively enc ompass all relevant

 spectrum use, however.”12. In addition, Shure would suggest including the behavior of the 
transmitted signal in time and frequency, such as, but not limited to, the following 
characteristics:  
• time response (on / off duration),  
• minimum a nd maximum burst length, and  
• occupied bandwidth.  
It would also be useful to include the target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that the service 
should deliver, such as, but not limited to, reliability, peak user data rate, average user data rate, 
latency , user density, and coverage. These service specific KPIs should also be considered when 
discussing an appropriate definition of spectrum efficiency.  
SIA recommend s “that the Commission de -link spectrum use from spectrum efficiency” 
13. Shure shares this t hought because as long as the definition of spectrum efficiency is based 
only on the number of transferred bits per time per occupied spectrum (see e.g., comments of 
Verizon14 or AT&T Services15), every system designed for high peak data rates seems to be more 
spectrum efficient than systems designed for ultra -low latency , but at the end both systems have 
to deliver the required KPIs. It is like comparing apples and pears. To do a fair comparison of the 
spectrum efficiency of different services, the definit ion of spectrum efficiency should include the 
delivered KPIs. Here, further work is needed to develop a metric or mechanism that considers 
and combines all the necessary parameters in order to obtain comparable results.

 Shure agrees with AFTRCC noting that “The best way to obtain and interpret spectrum 
usage data will differ by spectrum band and the service(s) authorized within the band. Not all 
spectrum uses are susceptible to uniform treatment in terms of assessing inten sity of spectrum 
uses.”16 As mentioned before spectrum usage should include delivered or target KPIs of the 
related service within the specific frequency band. Otherwise, it is impossible to do a fair 
comparison of all the different services using different bands.  
AFTRCC points out “that a number of aviation and aerospace uses also require access to 
reliable, interference -free spectrum when required to achieve high performance, even if such 
spectrum is not used continuously in a given location.”17 This is similar to the de ployment and 
usage of PMSE (Program Making & Special Events) with its very stringent requirements on 
robustness and latency. Both examples illustrate and underline the problem of defining a one -
size-fits-all approach for the various of services and frequen cy bands explained above.  
 
IV. Data considerations: challenges and methods for data collection  
SBE notes that “spectrum usage should be studied prior to data collection”18, which 
Shure fully supports. First, a common definition for spectrum usage and spect rum efficiency 
should be developed, second, it should be evaluated whether these definitions are useful and 
provide comparable and repeatable results, and third, a method for collecting and measuring data 
can then be developed using this new, generally app licable approach.  
Perhaps this new approach will lead to a standardized mechanism for data collection as 
mentioned in the NOI, but at this point of time it is almost impossible to comment.

1 PROBLEM STATEMENT  
In a recent press release article, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stated, “as the 
radio frequency environment becomes more congested, leveraging technologies such as artificial 
intelligence to understand spectrum usage and draw insights from large and complex d atasets can 
help facilitate more efficient spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable co- existence among users and services
1.” Given the volatility of technology, 
legal frameworks, and data volume, variety, and veraci ty, it is impractical to rapidly anticipate, 
prepare, and respond to various complex questions related to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).  
2 INTRODUCTION / EXISTING CAPABILITIES  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to show promise in many areas by unde rstanding large data 
sets, improving data quality, and predicting future outcomes. To exploit AI capabilities, 
Expression Networks, LLC (Expression) integrates a set of industry- best enterprise and open-
source  tools, and technologies to provide an environm ent, and develop capabilities that foster 
scalable and trusted AI. Expression is prepared to use our existing data lake, pipeline, governance, 
dissemination, and software factory capabilities to accelerate FCC AI endeavors at low risk. We demonstrate our c apabilities and expertise through our Defense Information Systems Agency 
(DISA) Electromagnetic Battlefield Management (EMBM) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Data Lake 2.0 solutions. Expression draws from our deep bench of EMS subject matter expe rts (SMEs) and data scientists (with 120+ combined years of experiences in AI and data 
science) who are familiar with EMS and how to align AI endeavors with business objectives to maximize value to the FCC.  
2.1 Infrastructure Enabling AI  
Expression specializes in establishing infrastructure and guidelines necessary to develop AI 
solutions, outlined below. 
 Data Pipeline– Provides data ingestion, cleansing, validation, and transformation  
 Data Lake– Enables storage and retrieval of structured, unstructured, and se mi-structured data  
 Data Governance– Establishes and enforces data owners, schemas, privacy, security, etc.  
 Data Dissemination – Application Programming Interfaces  (API s) published using the 
OpenAPI specification enable external credentialed parties to consume information for specific 
use cases  
 Data Science Software Factory – A collaborative environment for exploring information and 
creating AI solutions using a set of trusted toolsets  
The Expression team  focuses on using cloud technologies to ensure AI solutions are scalable and 
resilient. Selected components (e.g., data pipeline, data lake, software factory) are available 
worldwide, open- source, and non- proprietary. This paradigm provides a collaborative  
environment within Expression and between trusted contractors while reducing vendor lock. 
Expression applies our modular open- source approach (MOSA) when establishing an AI 
environment and creating solutions that deliver  significant cost savings, improve  interoperability, 
reduc e development timelines, and provide  opportunit ies to rapidly upgrade individual 
components. Our team employs  development, security, and operations (DevSecOps) technologies 
and best practices to provide operational efficiencies and m aximize AI cyber security .

2.2 Data Enabling AI  
Expression ha s extensive knowledge and experience  working with a variety of spectrum- focused 
information sources. The following EMS data sources represent potential candidates for 
incorporation into an FCC data l ake.  The EMS data sources include:   
 Frequency Assignments, Authorizations, and Licenses (various -  FRRS, GMF, ITU, FCC, 
CDF, Radio Astronomy, ToA) - Inform ation  on frequency allocation  
 Global Command and Control – Joint (GCCS -J) – Near -Real-Time force, fit, warning, 
information  
 Integrated Broadcast System (IBS) – Near -Real-Time force, fit, and warning information  
 End-to-End Supportability System (E2ESS), Stepstone – Department of Defense (DoD) and 
commercial spectrum system certification records  
 E2ESS -  Foreign spectrum dependent system supportability records  
 Joint Spectrum Interference Resolution Online (JSIRO) – Electromagnetic interference records  
 Telecom Advanced Research and Dynamic spectrum sharing system (TardyS3) –  Shared 
spectrum records  
 Automated Spectrum Coordination System (ASCS) – Shared spectrum records  
 Federal Spectrum Data Systems – System of systems containing National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration (NTIA) managed spectrum studies, system certification 
records  
This list is not exhaustive and our team is prepared to assist in identifying and integrating new data sources at a rapid pace. Examples of potential information sources include cell tower data, commercial spectrum plans with improved temporal or ge ographical detail, Internet of Things 
(IoT) sensed spectrum data, and community mobility data.  
2.3 AI Techniques  
The Expression team has expertise  implementing AI solutions using a variety of techniques 
including search/optimization, generative AI, large language models (LLMs), predictive analysis, and entity resolution. Our team recently demonstrated search/optimization for automatically 
constructing flight paths while avoiding enemy radar detection and electronic warfare capabilities. This feature can be adap ted for non -DoD use for rerouting commercial entities around EMS 
restricted areas.  
Expression created a rapid prototype using generative AI and LLMs performing text to query and content summary. For our text to query prototype, we used a LLM to introspect  our data schema 
and generate a SQL query from user provided free text. We then used t he query to generate asset 
laydown in a 4D geospatial interface. This capability has the potential to drastically reduce training, improve user satisfaction, while accele rating and enabling non -technical staff to easily 
search and analyze complex data sources. We also demonstrated the ability to automatically generate DoD compliant reports through database and unstructured object (e.g., free text document) queries.  
We used  predictive analysis for our DISA client to anticipate electromagnetic interference based 
on spectrum congestion and past interference reports. By anticipating spectrum interference events we enable users to plan spectrum maneuvers to avoid interference ah ead of time.",3,FCC_Whitepaper_Expression Networks.pdf,"Expression Networks, LLC (Expression) ",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Our team has had great success recognizing, resolving, and relating spectrum data through entity 
resolution. This process enables our clients to better understand how spectrum data is related, 
reconcile data inconsistencies, and merge traditionally disparat e information sets. We have 
successfully applied entity resolution in our DEA Data Lake 2.0 project to resolve incomplete and inconsistent data about entities such as people, vehicles, and drugs, and facilitate non- obvious 
relationship analysis.  
3 BENEFITS O F AI DEPLOYMENT  
Our team has identified potential areas of opportunity that harness AI to drive efficiency, minimize oversight, and enforce regulatory compliance more effectively. 
3.1 Impact on Spectrum from Policy Changes  
The enablement of AI allows systems to continuously monitor policy changes and answers the 
question “ what changes to legislative, regulatory, and policy frameworks could support increased 
non-Federal spectrum access while simultaneously preserving DoD missions?” Federal and local 
policy chan ges designed to improve spectrum efficiency or generate additional federal revenue 
have the potential to negatively impact spectrum activities. For example, in a 2020 congressional 
report  “the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized the Ligado 5G network, 
which could affect the global positioning system’s radio signals
2.” AI systems leveraging 
generative AI and LLMs can automatically sift through a vast amount of textual data, such as 
Government documents, news articles, and regulatory filings. They can automatically detect when 
a policy change may have a direct or indirect impact on spectrum allocation or usage. Once it detects a potential policy change, AI systems can analyze the content to assess its potential impact 
on various stakeholders. T his analysis may include evaluating the specific frequencies affected, 
the extent of interference, and the potential consequences for existing spectrum users. When it deems a policy change relevant and potentially impactful, AI systems can automatically ge nerate 
customized notifications and alerts to a wide range of stakeholders, including Government 
agencies, commercial spectrum users, and public safety organizations.  
3.2 Automated Analysis of Frequency Bands for Reallocation  
Frequency reallocation is a major risk for DoD and a significant revenue driver for the Federal Government. Manually identifying frequency bands that can be reallocated is a lengthy and tedious 
process. The rapid and continual advancements in spectrum technologies further complicates this 
issue. AI algorithms can optimize spectrum allocation by considering various factors such as demand, geographic constraints, and interference potential. Automated auction mechanisms driven 
by AI can help streamline the process of selling and reallocating spectrum licenses to maximize 
economic efficiency. Generative AI and LLMs further provide the ability to not only assist in 
identifying frequency bands for reallocation but also summarize their impact on DoD in easy -to-
understand reports. They can automate creation of tailored reports for specific audiences which 
highlight estimated revenue resulting from auction of reallocated spectrum while identifying DoD 
functions that support national defense. 
3.3 Improved Comprehension of Industry Studies  
The Government of ten releases solicitations to  industry to understand new and emerging 
technology in the spectrum domain. Potential questions in these solicitations might include:

1. What current or future technologies could facilitate harmonious spectrum sharing between 
unlike systems, such as next generation wireless and G overnment radars?  
2. What current and future technologies enable dynamic spectrum maneuverability and improve reliability in the use of the EMS in a congested, contested, and constrained spectrum environment?   
Generative AI and LLMs enable users to easily draw pros and cons of proposed technologies. Such analysis goes beyond simple keyword matching and can discern nuanced and context -specific pros 
and cons, providing a more comprehensive understanding. Generative AI and LLMs have the capability to condense lengthy and complex responses into concise summaries which not only save time but also provide a clear and structured overview of the key findings, enabling decision- makers 
to quickly gr asp the most important information.  
3.4 Identify Areas Best Suited for Spectrum Sharing  
AI enables systems to automatically and quickly assess areas that are best suited for spectrum sharing (e.g., cooperative planning areas or periodic use areas) while minimi zing interference. In 
this use case, AI, through machine learning (ML) algorithms and data analysis, can process a vast 
amount of data, including historical spectrum usage, user density, and frequency band 
characteristics. It can then identify areas with high commercial demand and low DoD spectrum 
congestion. The AI system ca n create a spectrum -sharing “heat map” that highlights regions where 
spectrum sharing is feasible and beneficial. These heat maps are dynamic, adapting to changes in 
usage patterns and regulatory requirements over time. The dynamic nature of these heat maps ensures that spectrum sharing remains flexible and responsive, aligning it more closely with the ever-changing demands of the telecommunications landscape. 
3.5 Enforce Spectrum Regulations  
With access to IoT and networking devices, AI -driven systems continuo usly monitor spectrum 
usage across various frequency bands, collecting data from IoT devices, networking equipment, and other sources that transmit and receive radio signals. AI's data collection capabilities also extend to a wide range of spectrum users, including commercial operators, G overnment agencies, 
and private entities. This comprehensive monitoring provides a real -time view of spectrum 
utilization. AI employs sophisticated algorithms to compare the observed spectrum usage with the Government licenses and assignments.  AI can easily identify and report on unscheduled or 
unauthorized spectrum access in near -real-time. This leads to regulators or AI to identify nefarious 
activities and actors, provide both a deterrent to these unlicensed emissions, an d execute a quicker 
response to reduce spectrum interference.",5,FCC_Whitepaper_Expression Networks.pdf,"Expression Networks, LLC (Expression) ",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Open Research Institute (ORI) is a non-profit research and development organization devoted to Open 
Source digital radio technology. ORI’s mission is to provide practical open source wireless 
communications solutions for terrestrial and space applications. ORI provides significant workforce 
development opportunites to the volunteers engaging in Open Source technical work. 
Open Source means that everything required to reproduce a software, hardware, or firmware design is 
freely available to the general public. An Open Source design must have free redistribution, allow 
modifications and derived works, and be non-discriminatory against persons, groups, or fields of 
endeavor. Open Source work cannot be specific to a particular product, it cannot restrict other software 
or hardware, and needs to be technology-neutral. 
Open Source is vital to the United States’ economic competitiveness in telecommunications. The 
Internet runs on Linux, an Open Source computer operating system, as 96.3% of the top one million 
web servers run on Linux, and the vast majority of the underlying networking infrastructure uses either 
Linux or other Open Source operating systems and libraries.
The telecommunications industry has historically been heavily reliant on proprietary software and 
hardware. An increase in the adoption of Open Source, from OpenRAN to Nephio, has enabled 
telecommunications companies to more quickly and efficiently meet market demands. There is a broad 
trend towards the continuing increase in adoption of Open Source designs in order to avoid silos of 
wheel reinvention and to promote effective interoperability. 
The Open Source community can address this inquiry. 
Introduction
ORI agrees that spectrum usage information is generally nonpublic and infrequently available. In the 
spirit of Open Source and Open Access, we believe that publicly available high-quality data about 
spectrum usage is in the national interest.
ORI agrees that the need for spectrum usage information will only continue to grow. In order to 
produce useful models, artificial intelligence and machine learning require enough data to complete the
training process. Without enough data, a machine learning model can suffer from a condition called 
overfitting. When this happens, the model becomes a very expensive copy machine, presenting the 
training data as output, regardless of the input. The lack of sufficiently large high quality 
radiofrequency data sets is widely acknowledged as an impediment to research and development for 
radiofrequency machine learning. 
ORI agrees that the development of new and innovative spectrum sharing techniques, allowing 
increased co-existence among users and services, will improve spectrum management. Spectrum usage 
information is required in order to develop new spectrum sharing techniques. This is true whether or",0,WT-Docket-No-23-232.pdf,Open Research Institute,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"not machine learning is used either in the process or in the product. In other words, even if only 
ordinary humans had the task of improving spectrum sharing over and above what we have today, those
humans would still need spectrum usage information to achieve their goal. Without good spectrum 
usage information, neither machine learning nor human architects will be able to confidently produce 
quality results. The most common outcome to making the best guess in the absence of spectrum usage 
information is highly conservative spectrum sharing arrangements that do not fully utilize spectrum, 
overly restrict licensees, and prevent innovation in the field. 
Central Question
We want a more sophisticated knowledge of non-Federal spectrum usage. The central question of this 
inquiry is how can we take advantage of modern capabilities for gaining this knowledge in a cost-
effective, accurate, scalable, and actionable manner?
In addition to the other spectrum monitoring efforts listed in this inquiry, we can start with the concepts
established by the Spectrum Monitoring Pilot Program from NTIA/NIST. This program measured 
spectrum occupancy with standardized distributed receivers reporting to Measured Spectrum 
Occupancy Databases. These databases publish the metadata of their measurements so that measured 
data can be retrieved over https:// connections. The concepts of federation are used in order to avoid 
inefficient and expensive replication of measured data. 
The Spectrum Monitoring Pilot Program had two classes of receivers. One was dedicated to radar and 
the other to communications. The communications receiver approach is an order of magnitude less 
expensive than the radar receiver approach. 
Restricting the hardware package to the less expensive category of communications receiver, and using 
modern software-defined radios with Open Source software, and incorporating existing online radios 
(“WebSDRs”) alongside the standardized stations, and being deliberate and innovative about 
incentives, then we assert that a low-resolution receiver network that can produce useful spectrum 
usage information is achievable. 
A Low Resolution Receiver Network – Why?
Why low resolution? Because a broad heatmap of spectrum usage, even at low resolution, is valuable in
a different way for spectrum management purposes than a small amount of high resolution data from 
one service in one geographical area. 
The current situation is of essentially no real-time spectrum usage information. Even if we simply had 
noise floor measurements across the bands across the country, and even if those measurements were 
gathered from stations of varying quality, we would have an immense improvement in our capacity to 
intelligently manage our spectrum over having no measurements at all. 
Towards a Weather Map of the National Noise Floor
Noise floor is the measure of the noise power per bandwidth. Getting a snapshot of something like a 
National Noise Floor, comparable to a national radar weather map, needs a diversity of radio receivers. 
We need to be able to measure or estimate power spectral density from these receivers. Services with 
intermittent use must be measured often enough to produce minimally accurate data, or those services 
must be covered with alternate techniques.",1,WT-Docket-No-23-232.pdf,Open Research Institute,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"As an example of where alternate techniques can work, FT8 mode contacts on the 17 meter Amateur 
Radio Service band can be obtained from https://gridtracker.org/ . These reports, which are text based, 
can be used to estimate the power spectral density at the radios using Grid Tracker. Reports from radios
can be used to create a map of real-time spectrum usage without directly measuring the spectrum. 
These are estimates, but they are based on measured signal-to-noise reports that all the radios are 
giving each other, in each 15-second long exchange.
We can compare this type of observation to eavesdropping on roomfuls of people talking to each other, 
and writing down how many conversations (and attempted conversations) there were. Multiple 
eavesdroppers can spread through the house, combine their notes, and show where the conversational 
density was highest. 
What does this look like on the 17 meter Amateur Radio Service allocation with a typical FT8 station? 
A stream of which stations contacted other stations is reported from a single radio. The stream consists 
of all the contacts that the radio has heard from that location. The radio is not directly contacting all of 
these other stations, but it can hear them all and tracks who is trying to talk to who and when. Any 
radio on the band can act like the eavesdropper above. 
Open Source software (called WSJT-X) is controlling the radio and demodulating and decoding all 
received transmissions across the entire sub-band. WSJT-X does include a spectrum waterfall display, 
which could be used to obtain power spectral density of all the simultaneous transmissions, but we do 
not have to do this. We instead use another commonly installed Open Source software program (called 
Grid Tracker) which takes the text output of WSJT-X and provides a text list of active stations and their
reported signal power. This list can produce a calculated estimate of the power spectral density in the 
band. It’s less math intensive to work with text based signal reports for fixed formal signals like FT8 
than it is to use a spectrum analyzer waterfall, or deal with the IQ recordings of a radiometer.
The addition of additional radios (more eavesdroppers) improves coverage. 
Does this exact network exist today? It almost does. Instances of Grid Tracker, very commonly 
installed alongside WSJT-X and running whenever the station is active are reporting all of this 
information, but they do not have coordinated reporting, as of today. However, since the software is 
Open Source, adding a function to opt in to do some math and donate the data to a server to produce a 
National Noise Floor snapshot, for this particular mode, is achievable. 
This example outlines a proof of concept of a very tiny slice of the HF spectrum at 18.100 MHz, but it 
shows the advantage of using existing Open Source software, existing radios and existing communities 
of licensed operators. Incentives to licensees to participate could be as simple as getting an opportunity 
to defend their licensed spectrum up to recognition awards for donating data consistently over time.
Achieving Aggregated Wireless Sensing
How can we broaden this concept? 
First, leverage existing online radio receivers, such as broadband WebSDRs. See 
http://www.websdr.org/  for deployed examples. Power spectral density measurements or estimates can 
be obtained from receivers already on the air and already connected to the Internet.",2,WT-Docket-No-23-232.pdf,Open Research Institute,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"An anticipated and understandable objection is that the multitude of WebSDRs across the country are 
not calibrated stations and they are not standardized. The owner could take them down at any time. A 
new one might be put on the air tomorrow. The answer to these objections is that the aggregation of 
these observations, even if the observations are of varying quality, provides immense value in efforts to
improve spectrum management because these receivers can produce real-time spectral usage 
information with no additional radio hardware investment. 
We should, of course, not stop there. We must commit to a both/and and not an either/or approach to 
answer the central question of this inquiry. 
Second, deploy inexpensive, standardized, and calibrated receivers to libraries, schools, post offices, 
and any other institution or organization that can be either incentivized or mandated. 
For a model of an Open Source standardized distributed receiver system producing real-world practical 
radio results, please refer to the SatNOGS project at https://satnogs.org/
What are some standardized station examples that we could deploy in the United States to achieve the 
goals of this inquiry? 
An Open Source PLUTO SDR running Open Source Maia software creates an inexpensive spectrum 
analyzer with a built-in webserver. The addition of the federated reporting functions is possible because
the source code for Maia can be modified to include these additional functions. Maia can be found at 
https://maia-sdr.org/ . Documentation for the standard PLUTO firmware (which is largely replaced by 
the Maia firmware) can be found at https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw  and 
documentation for the PLUTO hardware can be found at 
https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/hackers  
A PLUTO/Maia package can cover frequencies from 70 MHz to 6 GHz. It would requires one or more 
antennas (depending on how many bands are to be monitored by that station), a power supply, a 
weatherproof enclosure, mechanical attachments, and cables. A proof of concept would be expected to 
cost less than the Spectrum Monitoring Pilot Program communications receiving station proof of 
concept, which came in at $6000 according to “An Overview of the NTIA/NIST Spectrum Monitoring 
Pilot Program”. This can be read at https://its.ntia.gov/umbraco/surface/download/publication?
reportNumber=CottonSpectMonIwssSubmitted.pdf
A second and even less expensive example of a standardized station would be an RTL-SDR 
(https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/ ) and a Raspberry Pi ( https://www.raspberrypi.com/ ) running 
Linux. This kit can use a large number of Open Source software-defined radio packages. It can be 
tuned to any of the bands in its operating range of 2.4 MHz to 2 GHz. For a sweep of the entire 
operating range, multiple antennas and combiners would be necessary along with an amount of 
additional equipment and software. 
The WebSDRs combined with the standard package stations form a heterogeneous distributed receiver 
network. In aggregate, with enough stations, the resulting network can provide useful real-time reports 
of spectrum usage information. A centralized visualization of actual spectrum usage, even if not real-
time, would be very informative. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a 
thousand pictures. People seeing gaps in the data may be motivated to put up or sponsor a station to fill 
in the gaps, similar to the effect we see with personal weather stations that measure temperature, wind 
speed, and other meteorological aspects.",3,WT-Docket-No-23-232.pdf,Open Research Institute,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"TAC Working Group as Asset
The Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Working Group of the Technological Advisory Council of the 
Federal Communications Commission could provide advisory feedback on real-time spectral usage 
information obtained through opportunistic and inexpensive sensor networks, invite speakers to present
about the topic, and give specific recommendations. Leveraging an existing Working Group with 
familiarity in this particular topic would be an efficient use of already-available expert advice. 
Conclusion
A National Noise Floor heatmap, even if low resolution, is achievable and it is valuable. Any 
reasonable real-time data, whether obtained opportunistically or purposefully, is an enormous step 
forward compared to no data at all. 
There are drawbacks to low resolution data. The limits of the resolution must be acknowledged. The 
measurements have to at least be reasonable, meaning that a snapshot of noise floor includes enough 
information to where lower power signals aren’t completely overlooked or missed. For each frequency 
allocation measured, a subject matter expert in that allocation would be expected to compare the real-
time spectrum usage information to a model of expected spectrum usage. The difference between this 
theoretical or calculated model and the real-time spectrum usage information is valuable and 
informative in many ways. A subject matter expert would be able to explain observed differences, 
explain whether and why any difference was sufficient reason to make spectrum management 
adjustments, and provide feedback for improved spectrum sensing. There is no one-size solution for 
either the measurement stations involved or the allocations they are measuring. 
The architecture for gaining visibility of spectral usage has been previously piloted in the Spectrum 
Monitoring Pilot Program. This and other excellent prior work can be adapted, and citizens can be 
incentivized to participate in order to scale up the sensor network. Incentives range from the simple fact
of being able to individually contribute directly towards the defense of a spectral allocation, to awards 
or recognition for the technical achievement of constructing and calibrating a station to a published 
standard, to a scoreboard of who provided the most consistent reports of real-time spectral information 
over specific lengths of time. 
There is a large amount of Open Source software and hardware that can be used to reduce costs and 
reward high quality collaborative and cooperative work. A “lower-tech, inexpensive, diverse, and start 
now” instead of a “high-tech, expensive, maybe sometime in the future” approach is cost-effective, 
accurate (enough), scalable, and actionable.

Field Measurement Procedures 1
KARD-TV, West Monroe, LA operated on Channel 14 (47 0-476 MHz) with an effective 
radiated power of 5000 kW at HAAT of 570 meters, ho rizontal polarization (5000 kW) with no 
vertical polarization and an average effective heig ht of 570 meters (1870 feet). 
The field measurements were taken in a specially-eq uipped vehicle (see attached) which 
employs an antenna 9.1 meters above ground.  A grap hical chart recorder is used which is driven 
by an optical encoder that generates a series of pu lses proportional to the distance traveled by the 
vertical travel is used.  At each point the beginni ng and end of the measurement run was marked 
to allow for the second measurement to be made in a n identical manner. 
The median value of field strength resulting from a nalysis of the charts was multiplied by 
the field-strength meter constant and by the meter’ s attenuator setting. 
The field strength measurements at each location we re made during mobile runs typically 
160 meters (approximate 0.1 mile) with the receiver  antenna elevated at 9.1 meters (30 feet) 
above ground level.  The vehicle used for the  fiel d  measurements is a specially modified station 
wagon  which employs a telescopic pneumatic mast fo r the support of the receiving antenna.  The 
mast can be extended to a height of 9.1 meters (30 feet). 
The field strength measurements were taken with a P otomac field strength meter, Type 
FIM-72, serial number 104.  The dipole antenna whic h is supplied with the field strength meter 
(ANT-72) was supported by a telescopic mast mounted  on a “T” bar made of non-metalic 
material.  The dipole length was changed at each lo cation to the appropriate value for the station 
being measured.  Horizontal measurements were made with the antenna raised to its 9.1 meters 
(30-foot) level.  These field strength readings wer e recorded while the car was moved over a 
distance of 50 to 250  feet.  The field strength le vels for each measurement run were recorded on 
a Soltec chart recording instrument.  To facilitate  future measurement comparisons, the 
horizontal measurements were made along various rad ials utilizing existing road networks or 
measurement areas that are believed to represent a stable environment.  Therefore, where",96,comments 22-232 100323.pdf,"Cohen, Dippell and Everist, P.C.",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

1.	Executive 	Summary 	
Modern wireless transmission has  become a substitute for wired  quality connectivity rather than simply 
a means of reaching between two  locations without wires.  As su ch, expectations o f availability and 
quality have been heightened.  Fortunately, RF and baseband tec hnology has also progressed, allowing 
more precise use of the spectrum  resource compared to existing  services.  As freque ncy spectrum grows 
ever more crowded, the efficiency  of frequency allocations for  new services becom es dependent on 
increasing the effectiveness of  spectrum utilization.   Accordi ngly, new spectrum allocations featuring 
coexistence with current uses  are likely to seek more value fro m the spectrum resource while 
simultaneously improving interference management.  To aid the F ederal Communications Commission 
in its task of spectrum allocation for new services, the Techno logical Advisory Council has developed a 
set of basic principles to be co nsidered when making such decis ions. 
Basic principles of spectrum ut ilization are important for all  involved parties to consider, not just the 
regulatory authorities.  Realizat ion of certain facts of commun ications technology will temper the 
expectations of the incumbent se rvices using spectrum resources  as well as the new services that are 
trying to gain entry into the spectrum. 
The FCC faces a daunting respo nsibility when assigning frequenc ies to services; it must satisfy two or 
more conflicting interests.  On the one hand, services, some of  which spend large sums of money to gain 
access to their frequencies, desir e to yield maximum use of the ir “property.”   On the other hand, the 
interest of society is that the  frequency spectrum be used to i ts fullest potential.   Thus, the FCC must at 
times choose to place services in close proximity to each other  at the risk of interference between them.  
Much as with real private proper ty, easements impinge across pr operty lines for the good of the society.  
In a similar way, the FCC may have to choose to impinge on freq uency channels.  A set of nine principles 
introduced in this document addresses this concept so that all  users of the spectrum can receive the 
maximum value from their alloca tions while still meeting the ne eds of society. 
Continuing with the property ana logy, the best interests of the  society overall are met when neighbors 
go beyond what is required by law in order to get along.  Such  good neighbor policies are commonly 
found along property lines and it is logical to extend them to  spectral boundaries. 
The principles in this document  have been divided into three fu nctional groups.  Pri nciples 1‐3 discuss 
realities of interference that everyone must accept.  Principle s 4‐6 introduce  the concept of 
responsibilities that services in volved in potential interferen ce situations have to mitigate their",104,comments 22-232 100323.pdf,"Cohen, Dippell and Everist, P.C.",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Basic Principles for Spectrum Allocation  4  Release 1.1 interaction with other services.   Finally, principles 7‐9 prese nt requirements for, and actions that should 
be taken by, the regulatory authorities that make decisions reg arding spectrum allocations. 
Although these principles have been developed in order to aid t he FCC in formulating policy, it is clear 
that the requirements of differe nt services are varied.  While  some services require high reliability 
without regard for the excess cost of equipment capable of real izing this goal, oth er services have 
flourished in part because of th e low cost of their equipment a nd, as such, have had to accept some 
service degradation.  Clearly, “ one policy fits all” is not pos sible with such disparate requirements of 
various services.  Thus, though the principles espoused in this  paper will help with development of 
policies related to inter‐service  interference, the authors are  not suggesting that a concrete set of 
regulations will fit all services in the same way. 
This paper presents and discusse s the nine principles.  Followi ng this are examples of  actual situations of 
how these principles can be app lied to spectrum users, both in  cases where harmful interference has 
occurred and also cases where it has been successfully avoided.

Harmful 	Interference 	
The wording in the official definition of Harmful Interference  can be open to interpretation.  This is a 
large part of the purpose of the  nine principles that are being  proposed.   
Historically, the “har mfulness” of interfere nce has been expres sed as the amount of difficulty 
experienced by an individual attempting to accurately hear, vie w, or read the reproduced result of an 
original transmitted signal cont aminated by inte rference or noi se at the receiver.  Such human‐centric 
interpretations were founded on  analog transmission of the orig inal baseband inform ation.  Since the 
analog format allowed only real‐ time transmission, appreciation  of interference was completely 
subjective.  
As wireless systems grew to make  two‐way communication common,  descriptive terms were used to 
categorize quality.  An example of such an early measure was th e R‐S‐T system4, which employed 
numeric values representing the  Readability, Signal Strength, a nd Tone (in the case of Morse code) 
signals as a description.  
Although objective standards such  as “quieting” and SINAD sensi tivity later appeared to express receiver 
performance in the presence of n oise, correlation with “on‐the‐ air” interference to quantify an amount 
of “harm” remained difficult.  M easurement of carrier‐to‐noise  ratio evolved to become a primary 
metric of channel quality, where interference was included in t he “noise” definition. 
When analog picture and video transmission became pervasive, th e terms “imperceptible,” 
“perceptible, not annoying,” “slightly annoying,” “annoying,” a nd “very annoying” were added to the 
lexicon5 of subjective represe ntation of “harms.”

"Basic Principles for Spectrum Allocation  6  Release 1.1 When use of radio for critical c ontrol, remote measurement, rad ar, and safety applications proliferated, 
it became obvious that strong pr otection of these services was  needed since many of these uses could 
be time‐bound, require high accu racy, or be non‐repeatable.  Ac cordingly, the FCC coined the term 
“harmful interference.”6  Harmful interference is defined as “[a]ny emission, radiation  or induction that 
endangers the functioning of a r adio navigation service or of o ther safety services o r seriously degrades, 
obstructs or repeatedly interrupt s a radio communi cations servi ce.” 
Today, any interference level other than “harmful” is deemed “n on‐harmful” and is viewed as an 
acceptable part of using a spectrum resource wirelessly.  The I TU terms this concept “Permissible 
Interference:  Observed or predi cted interference which complie s with quantitative interference and 
sharing criteria contained in these Regulations or in ITU‐R Rec ommendations or in sp ecial agreements as 
provided for in these Regulations.”  The NTIA7 uses the term Allowable Performance Degradation to 
define how much interference can be tolerated without affecting  operations:  Agreed‐upon degradation 
in the performance of a radio co mmunication system due to inter ference that is at a sufficiently low 
level such that the performance capabilities are not significan tly compromised.  The  degradation is often 
referred to in terms of the percentage change in a key performa nce measure such as voice circuit noise, 
outage time, or target d etection probability. 
With the advent of digital information encoding, error rate was  added to carrier‐to‐noise ratio in a given 
bandwidth as a fundamental metric of received signal “goodness”  building on the information‐theoretic 
work of Shannon.   Digital coding also made it possible to tran smit compressed versions of the original 
information, allowing less bandwid th than the original content  to be used to convey material.  However 
it further complicated subjectiv e assessments of impairment, as  errors produced different audio and 
visual artifacts depending on th e compression type and the exac t location of the encoding where the 
error occurred. 
One of the problems going forward with newer digital transmissi on systems remains quantifying the 
extent of the “harm” judged by the receiving individual.  Now t hat digitally encoded information is 
commonplace, reception through im paired channels using automate d methods8 to quantify quality may 
be needed to objectively measure  QOE (Quality of Experience) in  networking environments. 
Until these methods become availa ble, the current state of the  art is likely to rely upon carrier‐to‐noise 
and error rate as fundamental pre‐detection and post detection  benchmarks, and harmful interference 
will be defined qualitatively as  interference that causes subst antial impairment of a communication 
signal.  Such degradation can be  quantified by a variety of tec hniques that must be subjectively judged 
in regard to the ability of systems to meet their service requi rements, or by the ability of purveyors of

guidance.  
If appropriate messaging can occur successfully then any interf erence to a signal cannot be deemed to 
be harmful.  Based on the needs of a signaling system, the defi nition of harmful will vary.  For instance, a 
public safety message generally n eeds to be accurately understo od without appreciable delay.  In 
contrast the typical data transf er can tolerate delays and the  typical video feed c an tolerate small 
inaccuracies.  Thus interference to a system that implements re transmission to corre ct erroneous data, 
thereby delaying its error‐free reception for an appreciable am ount of time, could be considered to be 
harmful in a public safety setting .  Yet the same interference  would be non‐harmful to many data 
transmission applications.  Likew ise, for instance, occasional  interference that caus es 100 milliseconds 
of garbling of audio could make a crucial public safety message  unintelligible and thus be considered to 
be harmful, while the same interf erence to a musical transmissi on could be non‐harmful. 
Interference 	Limits	
The process of applying quantitat ive signal measurement to the  determination of harmful interference 
has been described as Interferen ce Limits Policy.  Interference  limits are set in speci fic cases to define a 
level of signal appearing at the  antenna terminals of a service ’s receivers above which the interference 
to that receiver is considered harmful.  This can be quite vari able across services, depending on the 
requirements of a particular serv ice and its system behavior.   Once determined, interference limits can 
be used to define the minimum behavior of a receiver within a p articular service, thus insuring harmful 
interference‐free operation with a maximum efficiency of spectr um use.  Interference limits were 
introduced in white papers by th e FCC Technological Advisory Co uncil and are discussed further in 
Section 4 of this document.9,10 
2.	Interference 	Realities 	
Various terms for Interference have been used in many settings  and are not always in agreement.  The 
severity of interference often is defined by one’s point of vie w; understandably someone who is on the 
receiving end of interference te nds to view it as more onerous  than the person who is causing the 
interference, or even a third party.  The person running the sy stem that is trying to receive a message is 
usually intolerant of any interference while the interferer may  not be able to communicate successfully 
without causing some form of interference to others.  All parti es in the wireless communications arena 
must go into this field with certain realities about interferen ce in mind.

"Basic Principles for Spectrum Allocation  8  Release 1.1 Principle 	1:	Harmful 	interference 	is	affected	by	the	characteristics 	of	both	a	transmitting 	
service	and	a	nearby	receiving 	service	in	frequency, 	space	or	time.	
“It takes two to tango” is a we ll worn phrase that can be relat ed directly to the presence of interference 
in a wireless communi cations setting.  In  a system where freque ncies are assign ed to specific 
communicators, an unavoidable amo unt of energy leaks into every  channel from every other channel.  
The amount of energy contributed  by each transmitter on a diffe rent frequency can be controlled to 
some extent by the transmitting  system.  Likewise, the amount o f energy outside of the assigned 
frequency channel that affects a  receiver can be controlled by  the receiver design.  In addition, the 
strength of a potential interferer at a receiver can be affecte d by the distance betw een the two systems.  
As well, energy that could cause interference has no adverse ef fect if no one is listening at the time it is 
transmitted.  Thus the parameters of frequency, space and time  can be manipulated to decrease 
interference. 
Take the case of a system that requires its receivers to be abl e to detect very weak signals.  For example, 
in a narrow band system it is not  unreasonable for the receiver  to be able to hear far away transmitted 
signals that are heard at a lev el of ‐120 dBm.  FCC regulations  for many transmitters require that 
spurious emissions not be greater  than ‐13 dBm (Regulations als o specify ‐20 dBm for some narrow 
band transmitters and different l evels for certain other servic es).  Clearly, a ‐13 dB m signal will render a 
receiver that is listening for ‐120 dBm signals useless.  Howev er, all is not so bleak, as ‐13 dBm is 
measured close to the transmitting antenna and is usually consi derably smaller as the distance to the 
other service’s receiver increas es.  Also, even though a transm itter can have spurious emissions as large 
as ‐13 dBm they usually do not  occur at all frequencies but mor e commonly at harmonics of the 
transmission frequency.  In the unfortunate case where a spurio us emission of a nearby transmitter falls 
onto a weak signal system’s frequency, harmful interference occ urs even though all regulations have 
been followed. 
The most common parame ter that has been used in the past to les sen interference has been frequency.  
Frequency channels were spaced f arther apart than absolutely ne cessary to introduce “guard bands” 
between channels.  Going forward,  the presence of unoccupied gu ard bands is not compatible with 
societal need of more efficient  use of the limited spectrum.  A s guard bands are decreased or even 
eliminated, other characterist ics of all wireless communication s systems must be op timized to avoid 
harmful interference. 
 Principle 	2:	
All	services	should	plan	for	non‐harmful	interference 	from	signals	that	are	nearby	
in	frequency, 	space	or	time,	both	now	and	for	any	changes	that	occur	in	the	future.

signals may cause interference whe re they would not normally be  detected. 
Frequency reuse over distance is  an effective method to maximiz e effective use of the available 
spectrum.  With careful design an d layout, considering typical  propagation effects, different services can 
be collocated in frequency but pos itioned in space so that the  signal from each is minimal at the others’ 
locations.  Depending on the chara cteristics of the frequencies  used, various natural conditions, such as 
sunspots, meteor showers and atmo spheric temperature inversion  can extend the range of 
transmission.  For such conditio ns that occur infrequently, it  is not efficient to extend the distance 
between services so that they ca nnot detect each other under al l conditions.  Rather, the usual 
propagation is used to space services and then under unusual co nditions the services may cause 
interference for each other.  Services should expect that they  will occasionally receive such interference 
and should plan to use whateve r techniques are  available to the m to tolerate infrequent episodes of 
these conditions. 
For example, two suburban police  departments separated by 50 mi les were assigned to operate on the 
same VHF frequency.  The typical transmission distance of their  signals was no more than a 15 mile 
radius from their police stations.  However, this frequency ran ge was susceptible to temperature 
inversion ducting, which could ex tend the distance of transmiss ion as far as hundreds of miles.  Although 
this atmospheric condition occurred infrequently, when it did t he radio messages from one department 
were heard by the other and occasionally were disruptive to nor mal operations.  By implementing the 
technique of Tone‐Coded Squelch (CTCSS), with a different tone  assigned to each system, when the rare 
ducting propagation occurred it w ould not cause the squelch of  the other system to break and the 
distant transmissions were not heard. 
It is also important to realize that conditions of interference  today are unlikely to be the same as they 
will be in the future.  There are  many services that currently  operate with no services assigned to 
adjacent frequency channels.  If  these systems are designed to  operate under those conditions they may 
not work properly when other ser vices are assigned to the adjac ent channels in the future.  It is 
important to design systems to o perate effectively as if other  systems occupied the adjacent channels.

Propagation 	Variations 	
According to Maxwell’s equations,  the propagation of electromag netic waves is influenced by the EM 
properties and the geometry of the propagation medium.  Any bou ndary between different media or a

Temporary 	Intermodulation 	
Broadly speaking, intermodulation  occurs when some function of  the modulation of one signal gets 
transferred to another carrier.   Classical intermodulation occu rs when the modulati on of two or more 
input signals gets transferred to  a new third carrier frequency  (which may or may not be in the set of 
input or desired signal frequencies).  Classical cross‐modulati on has the modulation of one input signal 
getting transferred to the carri er of another input signal.  In  a receiver, strong signals (e.g., blockers) can 
result in desense of a desired signal by a variety of mechanism s.  In practice, intermodulation based 
desense often refers to the inte ractive effects that stronger s ignals (e.g., blockers) have on a weaker 
desired signal due to non‐linearities in the reception system.    
Strictly speaking, intermodulati on has occurred when a set of t wo or more signal frequencies at the 
input, once passed through a nonlinear effect, result in an exp anded set of output signal frequencies or 
distorted desired signals.  Generally, interest is limited to “ local” terms, or terms t hat have the potential 
to result in desense to one or m ore desired signal terms (i.e.,  not harmonics).  The prefix ‘inter‐’ 
(between, among) is generally tak en to mean the ‘modulation’ is  due to the mixing of signals originating 
from two different sources (radi os), though the same mechanism  results in an expanded set of 
frequencies (though only one “carrier”) even when they come fro m the same source (e.g. an OFDM or 
other broadband signal).  In transmitters, and even in receiver s, these effects are of ten termed spectral 
regrowth.  Another type of intermodulation that doesn’t result  in an expanded set of carriers is cross‐
modulation, where a distorted cop y of the envelope of the offen ding strong signal is transferred to the 
desired carrier frequency and becomes a relative‐amplitude co‐c hannel interferer. All three types of",111,comments 22-232 100323.pdf,"Cohen, Dippell and Everist, P.C.",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

etc. Clearly, when there are man y interferers present in a dens e environment, the opportunities for 
generating a potentially damaging  intermodulation product (one  that falls on the desired channel) grows 
rapidly.  For similar reasons, t hese effects can come and go fa irly rapidly (since they depend on the 
relative signal strengths of man y signals).  If there are only  two offending signals present, the number of 
3rd order intermodulation produc ts is only two: 2F1 – F2 and 2F 2 – F1.  However, when the input set is 
extended to say N terms, a third order nonlinearity yields N(N  – 1) double beat terms (of the form 2F2 – 
F1) and N(N – 1)(N – 2)/2 triple beat terms (of the form F1 + F 2 – F3).11  It is important to note that, since 
the offending signals all have a bandwidth if they are communic ating information, the bandwidth of the 
Kth order intermodulation term i s K‐times wider, so the intermo dulation term doe sn’t have to fall 
directly on channel to  cause a problem; even falling on adjacen t or alternate channels can result in 
desense if the distortion term’s  bandwidth is several channels  wide, as might be seen for broadband 
interferers. 
For a large set of blockers, eac h with random offered load, it  can be shown that the probabilities and 
locations of the offending terms can fluctuate wildly.  The des ense potential (i.e.,  the temporary denial 
of “full” access to the channel) f or the victim radio in a crow ded spectral environment becomes similar 
to a queuing availability of a c hannel (i.e. the “number of 9’s ”), though the availabilit y of the channel is 
not due to competition for that  resource but instead due to int erference from users competing for other 
resources, and is additionally dep endent on the strength of the  desired and undesired signals.  Often 
intermodulation terms will be generated and fall on channel, bu t due to the actual (time dependent) 
signal strengths of the undesired  signals, they may fall well b elow the receiver noise floor, or the desired 
signal may be high enough above the intermodulation product tha t there is no interruption of service.  
Thus it can be seen that the severity of an intermodulation pro duct is highly contingent on the locations 
of and propagation conditions between the spectral occupants.    
Such probabilistic intermodulatio n can become a more serious pr oblem when the offered load on the 
various communications systems dr amatically increases, such as  during a natural or man‐made 
catastrophe or other incidents th at trigger an increased need t o communicate.  There can be high 
activity on many channels at such  a time, increasing the probab ility of intermodulation terms, and there

"Basic Principles for Spectru m Allocation  12  Release 1.1 workers).12  In addition, in OFDM communicat ions systems (e.g., LTE), the  actual usage of resource 
blocks (i.e., groups of subcarri ers) is highly dependent on the  time‐varying load or data traffic on the 
system.  This results in a very  complicated interference enviro nment.   
In terms of intermodulation distortion and other related effect s, such phenomena often arise from near‐
far issues, where dominant inter ferer(s) and a weaker desired s ignal are present.  While these types of 
interference can be affected by numerous propagation effects me ntioned above, they often arise in 
dense deployments (e.g., where base stations are not co‐sited),  or in cases with differing deployment 
densities (e.g., a very wide area PS system interspersed with a  wide area macro‐cellular system).  Again, 
these types of interference can  be hard to control without prop er system (and inter‐system) planning. 
Service	Outages	
Whether from time‐varying intermo dulation interference, or othe r sources of interference (e.g., co‐
channel or adjacent channel inte rference), the net effects of i nterference can result  in temporary service 
outages in a given location at a given time.  Often times, stat istical models are utilized to model the 
propagation effects for both des ired and interfering signals (i n addition to the othe r statistical effects 
mentioned above, such as signal  fading).  For example in DTV se rvice, the propagation model utilized for 
computing a desired signal service contour is often the F(50,90 ) propagation curv e (R‐6602), which 
refers to a minimum expected field strength in at least 50% of  locations at least 90% of the time.  A 
more conservative F(50,10) curve i s often used to model interfe rence, or more deta iled Longley‐Rice 
calculations are utilized. 
Regardless of the exact methods used in modeling interference a nd signal propagation, there may be 
cases where service becomes temporarily unavailable.  This may  be due to propagation effects (e.g., 
shadowing, fading, ducting, etc. ) and the locations (in time, f requency and space) of desired or 
interfering signals.  Related si gnal distorting events such as  intermodulation also c an play a key role in 
interference and outages.  In som e cases, services may be speci fied for a particular system availability or 
coverage reliability.  Many factors (further described below) g o into estimating system availability and 
coverage reliability.13  The system availabilit y (SA, expressed as a fraction of time  the system should be 
available) or coverage reliabilit y (CR, expressed as a fraction  of locations that the signal should be 
receivable) may vary greatly depending on the particular system  or service.  For instance, a commercial 
cellular system may have a 90% c overage reliability requirement  (e.g., be reliably receivable in 90% of 
locations in a given area), wh ile a narrowband public safety sy stem may have a 97.5% coverage 
reliability requirement, and an  unlicensed (e.g., WiFi) hotspot  in a crowded area may have a 80% 
coverage reliability due to interference.  Similarly, a cellula r system may need to be available 99.9% 
(0.999) of the time to meet cus tomer requirements, while a publ ic safety system may need to be 
available 99.999% (0.99999) of the  time, while an unlicensed sy stem may need to be  available 90% (0.9) 
                                                            
12 For example, an LMR base statio n could be exposed to a highly  occupied spectrum with m any opportunities for 
intermodulation products while it is trying to receive weak sig nals from public safety or ut ilities workers deep within

general, any newly introduced interference events should not si gnificantly negatively impact the system 
availability or coverage reliabilit y of existing systems, since  these figures are often contractually or 
business driven.   
As mentioned above, interference can be highly time‐varying (du e to dynamic propagation and system 
loading effects), with different  effects on different systems ( depending on modulation and coding 
schemes, interleaving, error‐correction coding, transmission re petition schemes, etc.).  Thus, there are 
no simple formulas for reliably predicting interference, other  than the more ob vious cases of 
interference (e.g., receiving a signal with a very poor signal  to interference plus noise ratio (SINR)).  
Therefore, statistical models  are often utilized in an attempt  to quantify the overall effects of numerous 
interference sources.  Often tim es, Monte‐Carlo simulations are  used to model the i nteraction between 
complex random variabl es, to study the overall effects on the s ystem.  Of course, suc h results are only as 
good as the underlying models an d assumptions (i.e., the real w orld can indeed be a co mplicated place).  
For example, models th at don’t take into a ccount complex interm odulation terms may miss important 
cases of interference.              
In order to help estim ate system performance in the presence of  interference, several radio 
performance specifications are o ften utilized.  Often times, ra dios are specified to tolerate given levels 
of co‐channel, adjacent channel, and alternate channel interfer ence.  There are often specific in‐band 
blocking specs and intermodulatio n rejection (IMR ) tests in var ious systems.  Some systems may also 
have spurious response rejection  (SRR) specs or other related t ests.  Typically, these tests are specified 
with the desired signal some sma ll amount above reference sensi tivity (e.g., 3 or 6 dB).  While this is 
highly useful, the performance of  a receiver may change signifi cantly as the desired signal (and 
interfering signal) strengths cha nge, due to the non‐linearitie s mentioned above.15  Another 
complicating factor in these tests is that it is often hard to  properly foresee which other systems may be 
placed next (in time and frequency) to an existing system.  For  example, a broadband LTE system may be 
placed next to a broadcast DTV s ystem, or a broadband LTE syste m may be placed next to a narrowband 
(LMR) system, or in close proxim ity to satellite spectrum.  Thi s further complicate s the specification 
problem, since it may be hard to predict which interfering syst ems (e.g., broadband, narrowband) an 
existing system may encounter.  In general though, having a lar ger set of available radio performance 
specifications often results in  more accurate interference and  outage prediction. 
3.	Responsibilities 	of	Services 	
Once a service has been assigned frequencies it may still have  to make adjustments to its operations to

though there may be interactio n between the two effects.  A mor e precise computation of service availability and coverage

An ideal receiver accepts only the energy in its desired channe l, and thus rejects all energy outside its 
channel.  Actual receivers can o nly provide a finite amount of  rejection of unwanted signals outside the 
assigned channel. These interferers are commonly referred to as  Blockers. The ability of a receiver to 
reject unwanted signals is typically defined as a Blocking Mask , as shown in the Figure 3.1.  Blockers that 
produce energy above the mask lim it cause interference to the r eceiver.  
 
Figure 3.1   Receiver Blocking Mask 
 
The Blocking Mask requirements a re established by considering t he RF environment in which the  
receiver is intended to operate, including Blocker levels, numb er of simultaneous Blockers, bandwidth 
and time characteristics. These  are derived by reasonable opera tional scenarios and channel conditions.    
The ability of an actual receiver  to reject Blockers is limited  by practical considerations, such as power 
consumption, size and cost. Limi tations of the receiver to reje ct Blockers include bo th linear, nonlinear

degradation 	from	interference. 	
There are techniques at differen t protocol layers to mitigate d egradation from interference.  Discussion 
of the Protocol Stack is genera lly limited to systems that proc ess data digitally, however, in this setting 
the term “Stack” is being used to apply to all forms of communi cation, with non‐digital and legacy 
systems only making use of the lower layers.  For instance, in  a legacy analog radio system, filtering 
appears in the Physical Layer a nd modulation occurs in the Link  Layer.  The following list of techniques is 
by no means exhaustive, and not  all techniques w ill apply to al l forms of communica tion.  However, any 
form of communication can benefit  from at least one of the list ed techniques below, which are listed in 
order of their position in the Stack, from lowest to highest. 
 Directional Transmission. Focusi ng the transmit energy in the d irection of the user reduces 
interference to receivers in oth er areas. Lower transmit power  may be a consequence of higher 
antenna gains.  As the frequency of operation increases, the us e of directional transmission may 
be required to maintain adequate link performance. 
 Directional Reception. Directional antennas can be used by the  receiver to increase gain in the 
desired direction while reducing gain in unneeded directions.   A directional antenna combined 
with power control eases the ability to meet the link budget wi th reasonable power 
expenditure. Methods to achieve directional reception antennas  include physical antennas with 
directional characteristics (e.g . parabolic dish antennas and Y agis) or by combining multiple 
antennas using a phased array, o ften in an adaptive manner.  Op timal combining techniques can 
be used to maximize the receiver SINR, which inherently increas es gain at in the desired 
direction or steers a null in the direction of interferers.  
 Multi‐input multi‐output (MIMO)  antenna systems – MIMO is a gen eric class of techniques that 
makes use of spatial differences  in channels between the transm itter and receiver to achieve a 
number of system enhancements suc h as interference mitigation,  improvement in diversity 
order of the system and conseque ntly an increase in data rate,  and finally an improvement in 
spectral efficiency in a distribut ed wireless system made up of  many users, such as in a mobile 
system.  
 Power Control – The receiver pro vides SNR feedback to the trans mitter.  When interference 
occurs, which lowers the receive r’s SINR, the transmitter incre ases its output power to maintain 
the desired SINR.  Power control is also used to reduce the dyn amic range requirements of the 
receiver, thus preventing desensitization of receivers that hav e to discriminate between

"Basic Principles for Spectru m Allocation  16  Release 1.1  Channel Codes – A lower rate o f communication is usually associ ated with a lower rate channel 
code, corresponding to a greater a mount of structure in the tra nsmitted waveform and a higher 
effective energy per transmitted  bit. The use of lower rate cha nnel codes allows the receiver to 
operate at lower SNR levels, a nd without compromising the abili ty of the receiver to recreate 
the transmitted bits beyond a desired error rate. 
 Advanced receivers – Such receive rs will compensate for impairm ents and disturbances in the 
channel using a variety of tec hniques such as knowledge of the  channel, the color of 
interference statistics, structu re of interfering signals etc.   Such receivers would implement 
equalizers of appropriate complexity and may use a variety of s patial, temporal or frequency‐
based signal processing technique s to improve the performance o f the receiver as well as adapt 
to changes in the channel.  
 Time Interleaving – time interleaving is the spreading of infor mation in time (e.g. Block 
Interleaving), and is usually used to convert bursty interferen ce into randomly distributed 
events. The use of interleaving is  sometimes necessary to allow  error correction to be more 
effective.  
 Retransmission – the receiver requests that the data be transmi tted again when the original 
information is improperly receiv ed.  Retransmission can occur a t lower or upper protocol layers. 
In Type II hybrid ARQ systems, retransmitted information is enc oded in a way in which the 
energy of the prior transmission  is not lost, and prior transmi ssions are used along with 
successive transmissions to effect ively lower the code rate and  thereby increase the effective 
SNR of the combined transmission. A type of channel code design  known as rate‐compatibility 
may be used to derive individual channels codes used for each a ttempt as punctured bit or 
symbol sequences of a parent code of suitably lower rate. 
 Scheduling is used in mobile syst ems to transmit information ov er the channel over opportune 
temporal or frequency domain resources. It is typically useful  under varying channel conditions 
or varying interference conditions. The scheduler typically ope rates using rules that aim to 
insure a certain level of service.  
Some of these techniques trade system performance for a robust  and reliable radio link. For example, 
switching to a lower order modul ation will decrease throughput,  and Error Coding adds additional bits. 
In reality, many interference sources are statistical in nature . When considering this, the resulting 
degradation in overall system per formance is minimal while achi eving a reliable link, which is critical.  An 
example of the successful implementation of many of the above m itigation techniques is modern 
cellular networks, where simultan eous reliable links are achiev ed in challenging RF environments.  
Good standard engineering practice dictates that deployed radio s can operate in the environment for

4.	Regulatory 	Requirements 	and	Actions	
To make informed decisions about frequency allocations that max imize efficiency of spectrum use while 
still minimizing interference int eractions between services, th e FCC must be supplied with all of the tools 
that make prediction of levels o f interference possible.  In or der to successfully do this, the Commission 
needs sufficient technical details about all of the affected se rvices.  This includes detailed information 
about the operations of such services, a prediction of the leve l at which interference will become 
harmful to each service, and qua ntitative modeling about the in teractions between services over a wide 
variety of expected conditions. 
 Principle 	7:	Services	under	FCC	jurisdiction 	are	expected 	to	disclose	the	relevant 	standards, 	
guidelines 	and	operating 	characteristics 	of	their	systems	to	the	Commission 	if	they	expect	
protection 	from	harmful	interference. 	
Prior to assignment of frequencies, the FCC needs to determine  the compatibility between services in 
adjacent channels.  The determina tion of compatibility requires  information about the transmitters and 
receivers, as well as systems communication parameters.  Typica l questions that must be asked are: 
What is the maximum signal power  needed for a successful link?   What level of blocking immunity do 
the receivers have?  What tools  are available at the system lev el to correct for interference?  What are",119,comments 22-232 100323.pdf,"Cohen, Dippell and Everist, P.C.",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

acceptable throughput, the maximum latency?  With an appropriat e list of such parameters, the 
Commission can decide on the com patibility of neighbor services  to avoid harmful int erference and also 
determine who is at fault if harmful interference does occur. 
Transmitters and receivers need t o provide their spectrum masks .  Receivers should specify their level of 
protection from generating intermodulation, such as IP3.  Locat ions of operation for both transmitters 
and receivers are impo rtant for estimates of potential levels o f interference. 
The FCC has traditionally requi red that transmitters utilizing  a spectrum resource provide the important 
characteristics of the station, such as emission type, power le vel, height above avera ge terrain, antenna 
gain, pattern, etc. as part of the licensing process.   The inf ormation is usually mad e available as part of 
the public record.  This informat ion, aside from assuring compl iance with a license, has provided 
information useful for enforce ment and reconciliation of interf erence situations.  When the transmitter 
details are compared to a receiver system at a “victim” locatio n, it is possible to estimate whether the 
transmitter is operating within  its license limits and what mig ht be done to ameliorate harmful 
interference.  Remediation has customarily taken the form of di rect negotiation  between the 
transmitting and impacted parties , occasionally with the assist ance of the FCC. 
Supplying additional detailed info rmation about the operation o f the receiver and the system may be 
considered to be proprietary by  some services.  To these entiti es it has to be made  clear that the FCC 
can only work to prevent interference if they are given suffici ent information.  A spectrum user that 
refuses to provide such informat ion cannot expect the Commissio n to provide as much protection from 
interference as it could with all of the details. 
Increasing 	Automation 	of	Interference 	Resolution 	
With full disclosure of informat ion about system operation, nei ghboring services would also have the 
tools to solve interference issu es, often without involving the  FCC.  The evolution of spectrum

responsive “clearinghouse” repos itory for new band allocations.   Such a repository could contain 
transmitter and receiver information with security and rapid ac cess in which affected users could 
participate in a private Internet ‐based interactive measurement  and resolution process. 
With the advent of ubiquitous In ternet connectivity, many trans mitters (producing non‐trivial power

 Principle 	8:	The	Commission 	may	apply	Interference 	Limits	to	quantify 	rights	of	protection 	
from	harmful	interference. 	
Harmful interference is affected  by the characteristics of both  an interfering (transmitting) service and 
an affected (receiving) service.  For example, receivers that ca nnot reject interfering signals transmitted 
outside their assigned frequencie s can preclude or at least con strain new allocations in adjacent bands. 
Efficient allocation therefore i nvolves making trade‐offs betwe en receiver and transmitter performance.  
While radio systems are entitled to protection from harmful int erference, they must be able to reject 
non‐harmful interference. The Commission therefore needs a way  to communicate the limits of the 
protection to which systems are  entitled. One way is to mandate  receiver performance specifications; 
however, this has been very rarely used. Another way, recommend ed by the TAC16, is interference limits , 
that is, quantitative descriptio ns of the interference environm ent in which a radio systems needs to 
operate successfully without being able to make a claim of harm ful interference.  
Interference limits provide benefits to both the Commission and  wireless system operators by providing 
greater clarity about the entitl ements that are, and are not, e ntailed in assignments. This will be 
particularly useful in bands with many, diverse and frequently  emerging new technologies. 
Interference limits can be promu lgated by stating the out‐of‐ba nd and in‐band interfering signal levels 
that must be exceeded before a p rotected system can make a harm  claim. Since the electromagnetic 
environment is unpredictable, int erference limits will be stati stical by their nature, for example being 
given as received signal levels not to be exceeded for more tha n some small percentage of locations and 
times, along with a confidence l evel at which signals exceeding  the threshold would have to be 
demonstrated. 
Interference limits policies have recently been adopted by the  Commission: (1) as o ne of the conditions 
presumed to constitute harmful i nterference to SDARS operations  from WCS operation17 ; and (2) as the 
so‐called Reception Limits that  specify the amount of adjacent  channel and in‐band blocking 
interference that Priority Access Licensees must accept18 . 
Interference limits state the in terference at the antenna input  and make no reference to receiver 
operating characteristics; that  is, they are not receiver perfo rmance specifications. Manufacturers and

basis for a Notice of Proposed R ulemaking to enshrine in regula tion the interference limits agreed by the

Determining 	Interference 	Limits	
Interference limits would be determined on a case by case basis  for new allocations; different bands 
would have different interference limits. Performance degradati on as a result of interfering signals is 
system and scenario dependent; limits can be chosen to incorpor ate the needs of services being 
protected. 
If the bands adjacent to a new a llocation are already in use, a nd that use is not expected to change, the 
interference limit for the new allocation could be calculated ( by measurement, modeling, and/or 
reference to industry standards) t o reflect the characteristics  of the current neighboring use. This will 
ensure that the neighboring incu mbents’ operations will not be  deemed to be harmful under the new 
allocation’s interference limit. 
If one or both of a new allocati on’s adjacent bands are radio q uiet (i.e. result in low signal levels at 
affected receivers) but are plan ned to be converted to more int ensive use – for example, a band where 
an existing noise‐limited service will relocated elsewhere, and  be replaced by terrestrial mobile

allocation to set appropriately  their expectations about future  interfering signal levels that the 
Commission will deem to be non‐harmful. 
While interference limits are not receiver specifications, the  ability of the system  in the new allocation

discussed how interference limit s (called harm claim thresholds  in the paper) interact with receiver 
performance specifications; see  Section 3.5 in that white paper  and Figure 4.1 below. In short, 
interference limits are one of m any inputs to a system design p rocess and receiver performance 
specifications are an output. 
As the dotted lines in Figure 4.1 indicate, the regulator’s cho ice of an interference limit will most likely 
take account of the current or expected interference environmen t, which is in turn influenced by the 
deployment of transmitters in th e same service, as well as tran smitters in the interfering service.  
Interference limits and the expe cted RF interference environmen t are two inputs to determining the RF 
interference that a system must tolerate.  In the absence of in terference limits,  today’s status quo, 
system designers have to estimate  the likely interference envir onment around their receivers by making 
inferences from uncertain data like the likely transmit power o f interferers and the likely deployment 
density of transmitters.  However, as the figure shows, there a re other design inputs that include quality 
of service requirements, cost constraints, industry standards a nd service rules such as maximum allowed 
transmit power.  These factors are combined to yield an inter‐r elated set of specifications for 
transmitter and receiver performance, transmitter deployment, e tc. 
The connection between receiver pe rformance specifications and  interference limits is indirect since 
receiver specifications refer to isolated devices, whereas inte rference limits apply to an RF environment. 
For example, receiver standards  might specify the adjacent chan nel selectivity (ACS) of the receivers of 
the system that is seeking the pr otection of an interference li mit. However, the ACS is usually specified 
at a single, relatively low rece ived power level, and there is  no indication of how oft en a receiver will be 
exposed to such a situation in practice; the specification ther efore provides little guidance in 
determining an interference limi t framed as the interfering lev el not to be exceeded for more than

transparency in some of the past interference studies that regu lators and policymakers have relied upon 
in making important spectrum allo cation and assignment decision s. While this lack of transparency does 
not necessarily mean that the results of the studies or the dec isions that relied upon them are flawed, 
the absence of adequate transpare ncy produces at least two prob lems:  
First, the essence of the scient ific method is reproducibility.  That is, enough information should be 
provided about an experiment or  analysis so that  the results ca n be validated by other researchers. 
Without adequate empirical, com putational, and statistical info rmation20 on the research, it is difficult 
or impossible for other research ers to validate the results of  the interference studies even though the 
results may have serious impact in terms of economic and social  consequences and th e safety of life and 
property. In short, in spectrum  management, fact‐ or evidence‐b ased policymaking is dependent upon 
transparency. 
Second, transparency is critica l to improving and refining mode ls and studies that are based upon the 
empirical, computational, and statistical techniques described  immediately above. With transparency, 
other researchers have the abilit y to identify, e.g., through s ensitivity analyses, areas where

"Basic Principles for Spectru m Allocation  25  Release 1.1 improvements in interference models would have the greatest imp act and, as in the c ase of the Working 
Group’s efforts on RIIA, where th e risk of harmful interference  is particularly high or low. In short, 
transparency is essential in pro moting improvements in interfer ence analysis techniques. 
Based upon these two findings, th e Working Group came to the in itial conclusion that the FCC should 
improve the transparency of the interference analyses underlyin g its major spectrum management 
policy and regulatory decisions and, similarly, that it require  stakeholders and other participants in 
major spectrum management proceed ings to provide comparable tra nsparency in their pleadings. In 
reaching this initial conclusion , the Working Group observed th at opaque (rather than transparent) 
differences between models, their embedded algorithms, and thei r associated inputs as used by diverse 
stakeholders with varied interest s have led to widely different  interference results and produced bitter 
disputes leading to costly delays. 
While the Working Group recognize d that the primary role of the  TAC is to provide technical rather than 
legal analysis and advice, it did  observe that its conclusion r egarding transparency appeared to be 
consistent with the Office of Ma nagement and Budget (OMB) Guide lines for Ensuring and Maximizing 
the Quality, Objectivity, Utility,  and Integrity of Information  Disseminated by Federal Agencies.21 For 
example, the OMB Guidelines are intended to ensure that influen tial scientific, financial, or statistical 
information disseminated by agencies is sufficiently transparen t in terms of data and methods of 
analysis that it would be feasib le for a replication to be cond ucted. 
In the Guidelines, OMB observes that: 
The primary benefit of public transparency is not necessarily t hat errors in analytic 
results  will  be  detected,  although  error  correction  is  clearly  valuable.  The  more 
important benefit of transparency is that the public will be ab le to assess how much an 
agency’s analytic result hinges on the specific analytic choice s made by the agency. 
Concreteness about analytic choices allows, for example, the im plications of alternative 
technical  choices  to  be  readily   assessed.  This  type  of  sensitiv ity  analysis  is  widely 
regarded as an essential feature of high quality analysis, yet  sensitivity analysis cannot 
be undertaken by outside parties unless a high degree of transp arency is achieved. The 
OMB guidelines do not compel such sensitivity analysis as a nec essary dimension of 
quality,  but  the  transparency  achieved  by  reproducibility  will  allow  the  public  to 
undertake sensitivity studies of interest. 
In reviewing the OMB Guidelines,  the Working Group noted that t he FCC’s implementation of the

consistent with the Commission’s  existing policies of requiring  that advocates provide detailed 
information about cost models in  the context of Universal Servi ce. That requirement arises from the 
2011 USF/ICC Transformation Order,  which encouraged stakeholders t o participate in the process of

(CAF).23 
In the referenced Order, the Co mmission also cited a previous s tatement it had made that “all 
underlying data, formulae, comput ations, and software associate d with the [cost] model must be 
available to all interested parties for review and comment. All  underlying data should be verifiable, 
engineering assumptions reason able, and outputs plausible.”24 Finally, the Order promised that before 
the cost model to be used was im plemented, the Wireline Competi tion Bureau (WCB) would “ensure 
that interested parties have acc ess to the underlying data, ass umptions, and logic of all models under

parties to file models for consid eration in this proceeding con sistent with this Order,” implying that 
advocates of a particular cost m odel must also make their under lying data and computations available 
for analysis.26 
The Working Group found that Uni versal Service reform and impro ved spectrum management are two 
of the Commission’s most importan t efforts and that transparenc y and the broad public interest 
benefits it produces are equally important in both contexts. Th e Working Group also noted that if, for 
some reason, the Commission was  hesitant to require transparenc y and reproducibility in the spectrum 
management/interference analysis  context, it could, in an inter ference dispute, simply note that it 
would give more weight to evidence presented in a transparent a nd reproducible form. Doing so would 
incentivize stakeholders and othe r participants in major spectr um management proceedings to provide 
comparable transparency in their pleadings.

lead to more efficient and effective use of the spectrum.  It i s in the best interests of both society and 
users of the spectrum that this be implemented wherever practic al.",131,comments 22-232 100323.pdf,"Cohen, Dippell and Everist, P.C.",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Basic Principles for Spectru m Allocation  31  Release 1.1 The nine principles are categorized into three groups.  The fir st group contains realities of 
communications physics with respect to interference.  If users  of the spectrum accept these facts then 
they are less likely to have unr easonable expectations.  The pr inciples make clear that interference is not 
simply one signal impinging another but is a more complicated r elationship between a transmitted 
signal, the characteristics of a  receiver, the frequencies on w hich both devices operate, the spatial 
distance between them and the times at which they operate.  A v ery important realization that 
spectrum users should have is th at operating conditions are rar ely constant and even if little 
interference is detected today, varying propagation conditions  and new frequency allocations can 
change that in the future.  Systems should be designed to be ab le to operate properly under expected 
conditions even if they are not evident right now. 
The second group of principles deals with responsibilities of t he different services to minimize the 
effects of interference with each other.  The FCC has regulatio ns that require transmitters to limit the 
amount of their energy that goes  outside of their assigned chan nels.  However, such requirements are 
upper limits of allowable spurious  signals.  If a transmitter i s capable of further decreasing the levels of 
its spurious emissions then it sh ould do so in order to be a go od neighbor to other services.  The FCC 
does not have regulations that require a receiver to reject any  other signals in the spectrum but it is in 
the receiver user’s best interes t to make use of current techno logy to minimize interference.  
Improvements to both types of de vices are often expensive to im plement, and cost is a valid 
consideration when planning commu nications systems.  However, i f it is decided that interference 
avoidance now as well as in the future is more important than t he additional cost then such design 
changes should be performed.  System design techniques that may  not lead to much additional 
hardware cost can also be consid ered in order to deal with curr ent or potential future interference.  
Such techniques affect the opera tional aspects of the communica tions and may affect such things as 
data throughput but if such conce ssions are acceptable then the  ability to withstand interference is 
enhanced. 
The third group of principles is directed toward the FCC.  In m aking decisions about allocating 
frequencies to services the Commi ssion must consider the capabi lities of incumbent services as well as 
those of the new services.  To properly perform their tasks, th e regulators need to know as much 
information about the services a s possible.  With specific defi nitions of the operating requirements and 
behavior of the equipment and sy stems being used, an optimal ch oice of frequency allocations that will 
avoid harmful interference can be made.  With sufficient inform ation the FCC can choose the optimal 
frequency and physical spacing between systems so that maximum  use is made of the spectrum while at 
the same time systems will opera te as expected in the presence  of the inevitable interference.  To 
protect the services from harm,  the same information can be use d to calculate interference limits, which 
would then be used as an objective measure for enforcement purp oses. 
Considerable calculation is requi red to arrive at these goals.   Many different modeling algorithms exist 
to help with this process.  Every  modeling program requires tha t operating assump tions be made in 
order to arrive at a prediction of the behavior of systems.  Th e large number of choices of modeling and

“Advanc ing Understanding of Non- Federal Spectrum U sage ”.   
 
Spectrum Usage Definitions  
Spectrum usage can be de fined a number of different ways  using t he traditional methods of 
timed usage, percentage of occupancy, and geographic coverage .  These methods  present a 
uniform way to analyze  a particular spectrum band and its usage  against a 100% requirement . 
While effective in this regard, these methods typically operate without factoring in the expected 
usage of the incumbent(s).  Without consideration of the expected usage patterns , the  traditional  
parameters can present a skewed view of the incumbent actual usage  versus the expected .   
Not all metrics for usage are absolute especially  when it comes to the use of spectrum.  As federal 
users have found in recent history, the measure of usage  being based on a 100% occupancy scale  
is not necessarily an equitable representation of the actual planned usage for the spectrum.  The 
spectrum usage data captured should be able to be compared and measured against the actual 
expected usage of the spectrum resource.  This is a more representative measure of usage against 
requirement rather than usage against a 100% measure of time/bandwidth, and geography.  
When viewed through this perspective , spectrum with a limited use  offers the opportunity for 
new static and dynamic sharing mechanisms to work in concert with the defined usage patterns.  
These opportunities to share open the door to  better use of the spectrum resource.   
As a first step, condu cting studies to establish usage patterns through captured occupancy data 
using  long -term spectrum monitoring can provide the input that defines the usage pattern and 
the actual occupancy.  This data can then be used to compare with the expected levels of usage 
and occupancy (which may not be 100%).  The results provide an opportunity to work with 
incumbents to define time periods, geographic locations and additional relevant metrics that can 
be used for alternate licensing of spectrum.  Modern spectrum management capabilities can be used to implement this type of license sharing through scripted automation that factors in the 
relevant date, time, coverage vector, and spectrum bandwidth .  This type of automation used by 
other regulators around the world have resulted in a spectrum dividend allowing optimized use of spectrum.  
 
Spectrum Monitoring for Spectrum Usage  
As noted in the previous section, the incorporation of long -term and continuo us spectrum 
monitoring can provide the usage patterns and occupancy data that can be used as an alternative to an absolute spectrum license. The parameters can be set based on the expected usage and measured accordingly to get the real usage indication for  the spectrum  of interest .  Time, 
location, coverage, and required spectrum capacity are all key elements to understand in establishing the proper measure of the spectrum.  
Over the past several years, long term monitoring capabilities (installed on a tempo rary or",1,LS telcom Submittal for FCC NOI WT Docket No 23-232 - 231004.pdf,LS telcom,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

permanent basis) have made significant advancements in the processing of data to get to tangible 
results concerning spectrum usage.  Sever al examples of advancements in the spectrum 
monitoring space are  explained below : 
• Multi -Vendor Data Processing  – A challenge to  achieving efficient spectrum monitoring is 
the ability to use existing monitoring equipment from multiple vendors.  Compatibility 
across numerous platforms allows for currently deployed equipment to be leveraged as 
part of a larger soluti on.  There are products available today that are able to combine such 
inputs and produce the spectrum usage and occupancy studies described in the NOI 
document.    
• Licensing Automation Driven by Usage –  Spectrum management systems have also 
evolved over the past few years to allow  the incorporation of dynamic usage data into the 
spectrum licensing decision.  This scripted automation includes the usage data in the allocation method and procedure to determine the appropriate frequency to license.  These sy stems allow for flexibility to define such automation based on user group, 
spectrum used, date/time, or coverage vector.  
• Network Traffic  Monitoring – New solutions are being introduced to the market that allow 
for the monitoring of cellular networks and the operations of the cell site infrastructure with the collected data being processed in the cloud to then deliver a series of metrics indicating the performance of the network.  As fixed monitoring stations these devices have the advantage over traditional  drive test solutions as they are always on at the same 
location.  This type of solution can be deployed on a temporary basis to categorize the network performance in a given area then move to the  next area of interest or on a 
permanent basis.   
 
Summary  
The requirement for accurate spectrum usage data is a key element of optimized wireless 
operations across government, military, and commercial systems.  Throughout the different bands and communication types, the limited resource of spectrum is consistent.  The use of targeted and intelligent spectrum monitoring solutions can provide the type of data and analysis that identify areas for optimization of the use of spectrum.",2,LS telcom Submittal for FCC NOI WT Docket No 23-232 - 231004.pdf,LS telcom,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

COMMENTS OF 
THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA  
The County of Los Angeles, Calif ornia (“LA County”), through co unsel and pursuant to 
Sections 1.4
15 and 1.430 of the Commission’s Rules, 47 C.F.R. § § 1.415, 1.430, hereby 
respectfully submits its Comment s in response to the Commission’s Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) in 
the above-captioned proceeding.1 
I. BACKGROUND
In this proceeding, the Commission seeks to utilize next-genera tion techniques and data-
driven analytics to analyze non-Federal Spectrum usage.  As one of the largest users of public 
safety spectrum in the nation, L A County has a significant inte rest in this proceeding.  
Specifically, it is the goal of LA County in this proceeding to  ensure that the Commission’s 
review is accurate, i ncludes all non-Federa l usage, and recogni zes the differences in spectrum 
usage between public safety and commercial users. 
LA County’s spectrum usage is vast.  It includes VHF spectrum t o connect firefighting 
services, 800 MHz spectrum for th e County’s internal agencies, 700 MHz and 470-512 MHz 
1 Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket No. 23-232, released August 4, 2023.",0,LA County Spectrum Usage Comments 10-3-2023.pdf,THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"spectrum for its Sheri ff’s radio system, 4.9 GHz spectrum for a  variety of services,2 and 
spectrum in the 6, 10, 11, 18 and 23 GHz microwave bands to tie  these systems together. 
II. COMMENTS
Initially, it should be stated that LA County supports the Commission’s review of 
spectrum usage.  That review should be all inclusive, in that i t should include all bands and all 
types of users, both commercial and non-commercial, with an eye towards optimizing spectrum 
utilization.  In spect rum starved areas suc h as Southern California, it is entirel y appropriate for 
the Commission to ensure that spectrum--whether acquired throug h auction, by lottery, or 
through application--be made available for its highest and best use. 
For example, in the 216-218 MHz Band, only 29 of the 326 commer cial geographic 
licenses issued by the Commission remain active on the Commissi on’s Universal Licensing 
System (“ULS”) database.  Howev er, the Commission has not sough t to re-auction this valuable 
resource since it was first auctioned in 2000.  There are other  frequency bands that should be 
similarly reviewed, including broadcast ba nds.  Indeed, the Com mission should review 
alternatives to the current broadcast system, where some TV stations have little over-the-air 
2 Los Angeles County Sheriff Department utilizes the 4.9 GHz spec trum to provide a communications downlink 
between Air Support units and dispatch (as well as ground units ).  The 4.9 GHz link allows  the live video stream 
captured by the air units to be relayed to dispatch and ground units for real-time information sharing during 
many differing Law Enforcement a ctivities such as suspect/vehic le pursuits. Los Angeles County Fire 
Department utilizes the 4.9 GHz s pectrum to create a mesh commu nications link between Life Guard Tower 
units and dispatch.  The Los Angel es County Life Guard towers a re movable structures and as such have had 
many issues with hardline wiring  to provide communications links.  The wireless (4.9 GHz) links allow the 
towers to be physically moved and still have the critical commu nications link between the towers and dispatch 
for life saving operations. Los Angeles County ISD (Internal Services Department) utilizes the 4.9 GHz spectrum 
to create a WiMAX mesh data commu nications link to provide crit ical data links during wired infrastructure 
outages. These links c onnect data systems that are critical to the County and are necessary for COOP 
(continuity of operations) and GOG (continuity of Government) p rograms to ensure that the County of Los 
Angeles can provide critical ser vices to the population at larg e in any emergency or disaster.

"viewership, and thus have channel assignments s trictly to be co vered by the Commission’s cable 
must-carry rules.3 
LA County appreciates that the C ommission recognizes the limitations of the ULS.4  As 
seen in the Commission’s 4.9 GHz proceeding, simply a review of license volume that does not 
consider how licenses in a part icular band are utilized can lead to extremely inaccurate results.5 
The NOI seeks comments on how to define spectrum usage.6  LA County asserts that 
there are, and properly should be , different definitions of spe ctrum usage for different services.  
There is no “one-size-fits-all” in this case.7  In trying to perform an analy sis of spectrum usage, 
and attempting to define “usage,” the Commission must also cons ider the differing types of uses 
of spectrum between services, including the impact of unavailability of radio systems at any particular moment.  Specificall y, public safety radio services are deployed to provide 
communications during the worst  of emergencies, and thus may have periods where usage is 
low.  However, when such emergenci es occur, they serve as a vital lifeline for the delivery of 
police, fire, and EMS services in t he most chaotic of situation s.  Therefore, public safety radio 
systems must be robust, redundant , and always available.  In co ntrast, temporary service outages 
in some other radio services w hile not being optimal are nevert heless acceptable.  But such 
outages in public safety co mmunications risk lives. 
In other words, in addition to quantitative analysis of spectru m usage, there must also be 
a qualitative analysis of spect rum usage.  The “highest and bes t usage of spectrum” must include 
a societal analysis of the consequences of a failure to provide  adequate spectrum for high

"urgency communications.  Some of  the methodologies cited by the  Commission in the NOI,8 
such as spectrum monitoring, do not account for this qualitativ e factor. 
On this basis, LA County recommends that the Commission closely  consider NTIA and 
NIST’s definition of “band occupancy” to be based upon a “ user-defined  threshold.”9  Thus, if 
the Commission is to i ncorporate the ITU de finition of “spectru m occupancy” to include the 
probability of a channel being in use at a predetermined moment  in time,10 the probability 
threshold must be different from service to service.  Further, this definition does not account for 
“always on” services, such as broa dcast, which must include a d ifferent metric (viewership) in 
order to be analyzed. 
In paragraph 18 of the NOI , the Commission questions wheth er a factor of geographic 
usage should be included in the analysis.11  LA County agrees that ge ography is an important 
component in a spectrum utilization analysis.  For example, Southern California’s sprawling 
geography includes mountains, a  border with Mexico, and thermal  inversions ( ducting) that 
directly impact spect rum utilization and a vailability.  This la st consideration, ducting, has been 
recognized by the Commission on mult iple occasions as creating interference throughout the

"area.12  As far back at the 1970s, the Commission sought to analyze th is phenomenon in 
Southern California, and take it into account in spectrum assig nments.13 
LA County in particular has bee n deeply and negatively impacted  by ducting in 
deployment of its 470-5 12 MHz (“T-Band”) public safety radio sy stem.  Ducting in the area 
causes public safety users in the area to build ou t more sites,  and with more frequencies, than 
would be the case in other part s of the country.  Thus, LA Coun ty urges the Commission to 
complete its study on ducting, and th en take this factor into a ccount in measuring spectrum 
utilization. 
The difficulty for the Commission will be determining the most accurate measure and 
proper consideration of many of the se factors that are particular to a frequency band, a service 
category, or geography.  Virtually any quantification factor ap plied for purposes of comparison 
across services is arguably artificial and would be subject to much debate.  For this reason, LA 
County opposes the static metric suggested by NTIA in its Plan For Quantitative Assessment of 
Spectrum Usage, as it does not take these variables into account.14  Thus, LA County 
recommends that the Commission adopt analysis factors particula r to each situation, and refrain 
from comparing different services  in any but the most similar o f considerations. 
12 Atmospheric ducting is defined as “the atmospheric trapping of  [an] … RF signal in the boundary area 
between two air masses, hot air over cold air or vice versa. Du cting of [an] … RF sig nal is caused by an 
atmospheric anomaly known as tem perature inversion. Ducting is an anomaly of nature that can affect how well 
RF propagates through a given area. If the ground temperature i s 30°F up to 2000 feet, and then there is a layer of 
ice cold or very hot air, the RF signal could be trapped betwee n these two air masses and propagate for as long as 
the duct exists. The duct could go on for hundreds or even thou sands of miles.…Ducting is undesirable in RF 
propagation design, but also unavo idable.” Clayton, Jade, Illus trated Telecom Dictionary , McGraw-Hill (3rd Ed. 
2001), pp. 38-39. See also Tomasi, Wayne, Electronic Communicat ions Systems – Fundamental through Advanced,

"To the extent that the Commissi on desires to also review system design techniques,15 it 
should note that any alleged short- comings of existing licensee s in system design must take into 
account equipment and service life -cycles, as well as regulator y realities.  For example, while 
analog AM broadcast radio services  are the norm, the eventual t ransition to digital transmissions 
is a very long-term project.16  Therefore, any measuring of such a service during its transit ion 
must take into account its regul atory status, which may mean th at the service is temporarily less 
efficient in spectru m utilization.  This ha ppened during the 800 MHz rebanding, a Commission-
projected thirty-six month project that actually—ultimately--to ok over five hundred forty months 
(fifteen years), and was far more costly for both Sprint Nextel and public sector licensees than 
originally anticipated.17 Had the Commission conducted an analysis of public safety use in the 
800 MHz band during this time period, it would have found inefficient use in the band as many 
licensees were utilizing two set s of frequencies during their t ransitions.  Similarly, while the 
Commission was analyzing how to comply with Congress’ mandate t o relocate public safety T-
Band licensees,18 it would have found numerous pub lic safety licensees licensing additional 
spectrum for potential reloca tion options, which would have res ulted in an inaccurate analysis of 
public safety spectru m utilization. 
Time metrics, as discussed in paragraph 19 of the NOI, are particularly irrelevant to the 
public safety radio services.  Eme rgency services must be deliv ered in equal measure regardless

"of time of day, and the quantit y of such communications varies only by the nature of the 
emergency, not the hour. 
The Commission asks whether fixed point-to-point or fixed-to-mu ltipoint services should 
be evaluated differently t han with mobile services.19  A problem with this pr oposal is that these 
fixed systems carry the traffic from mobile systems from sight to sight, and thus are an integral 
part of any wide-area mobile sys tem.  They are inexorably linke d, and a mobile system has only 
a limited range without its int erconnecting fixed system. 
It is LA County’s position that the Commission should develop d ata collection specific to 
each frequency band and service .  For example, Part 22, 90, and  95 services should begin with a 
spectrum audit, i.e. issuing a query to each licensee as to their service status ( in operation vs. off 
the air), which in and of itself may result in a significant re capture of licensed but unused 
spectrum.  Further, such revie w should not be on a license-by-l icense basis, but rather on a 
system basis.  In the case of LA County, this would result in r eporting to the Commission the 
usage of spectrum for sets of users across multiple frequency b ands (VHF, UHF, T-Band, 700 
MHz, 800 MHz and Microwave), which will provide the Commission with a more complete 
picture of spectrum utilization.  Because of the length of time  this review by the Commission 
will entail, tools to conduct further analysis utilizing resour ces beyond ULS can be developed on 
a parallel path.  Proceeding in thi s manner can create some sho rt-term gains, through the 
cancellation of licensed b ut inactive systems,20 and efficiencies while the “deep-dive” analytics 
can then be applied to a small er universe of spectrum. 
19 NOI at para. 22. 
20 Many Part 22, 90 and 95 licensees are unaware that they must “ turn-in” their authorizations when operations 
are discontinued. Thus, there ar e likely thousands of authoriza tions that remain active, but do not represent 
operational systems. Since licen ses are now issued for 10 years  periods, as compared to the prior 5 year licenses, 
the number of licensed-but-unco nstructed facilities is far higher.  A prior audit by the  Commission of various 
services in 2001-2005 was highly  successful, but no audit has b een conducted since that time.

"LA County believes that the Commission’s proposal to utilize cr owdsourcing for data 
collection is fraught w ith potential issues, from misunderstand ings about the particular usage in 
specific bands to potential prejudi ces with the sources used, w hich may taint the results.  Thus, 
LA County recommends that the Commission utilize its own databa se and resources, along with 
Commission designated entities such as frequency advisory commi ttees.  LA County also 
believes that the Commission ca n save considerable costs utilizing this methodology. 
III. CONCLUSION
LA County’s spectrum u tilization is expansiv e, substantial, and vital to the public safety 
needs of the County and the Southe rn California region.  LA Cou nty encourages a 
comprehensive spectrum review by the Commission which considers  a variety of factors, as 
detailed above.

COMMENTS OF VERIZON 
I. INTRODUCTION.  
As the Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”)  recognizes , it is important to foster technology and 
policy strategies that promote efficient management of  our increasingly congested spectrum 
environment.1  Efforts across government  are necessary  to ensure that finite spectrum 
resources —allocated for  federal or  non- federal  purposes —are efficiently used and that all 
spectrum users are good stewards of the airwaves .  While the NOI seeks comment on non- federal 
usage only, spectrum occupancy and efficiency is an issue relevant for all spectrum users.  T he 
government  should promote sound spectrum management by federal agencies and non- federal 
users alike.  This is particu larly important for federal users, given their absence of market 
incentives to use spectrum efficiently and their vast spectrum holdings, particularly of valuable 
mid-band spectrum.   
As the Federal Communications Commission  (“Commission”)  considers issues of non-
federal spectrum usage, it should acknowledge that the market- based spectrum access model that 
applies to  commercial wireless licensing creates  considerable incentives for efficiency  in 
spectrum use.   Simple economics dictates that commercial w ireless licensees use their spectrum

"2 holdings as efficiently as possible: wireless providers invest billions of dollars to acquire and 
build out spectrum  in their networks, and they are geared to leverage more bits out of every 
megahertz of spectrum available.  It is not surprising then that c ommercial wireless licensed 
spectrum use became 42 times more efficient during the 4G decade, and 5G networks will further increase spectral efficiencies  by as much as 52 percent by some est imates in the mid -band 
range.
2  As the Commission investigates potential vehicles for assessing non- federal spectrum 
occupancy and usage, it should recognize the  built-in incentives of commercial wireless 
licensees .   
The Commission should also evaluate any targeted  frequency ranges on an individualized 
basis .  Doing so will enable all stakeholders to thoroughly assess the equities and specifics of the 
relevant frequency band .  The Commission should also ensure that commercial wireless 
licensees are not burdened with unnecessary or onerous data collections.  Finally, while efficiencies are long pursued and regularly achieved in the commercial wireless context, additional spectrum resources are needed in the near - and medium-term to address growing data 
demands. II. LICENSED  COMMERCIAL WIRELESS PROVIDERS USE SPECTRUM

providers are supporting those needs with less low- and mid-band spectrum than peer providers internationally.  U.S. wireless networks supported 73.7 trillion MB of traffic last year alone,

"3 which is nearly double the year-over-year increase from 2020 to 2021 and represents the largest 
single- year increase in mobile data traffic ever recorded by CTIA.3  And by 2028, total mobile 
data traffic in North America is projected to reach 21  EB/month, a more than four- fold increase 
over 2021, according to Ericsson.4 
The commercial wireless industry ha s handled this massive growth in demand despite 
only modest growth in spectrum access.  While U.S. mobile data traffic skyrocketed almost a hundredfold between 2010-2019, the amount of low- and mid- band spectrum available for 
licensed commercial wireless us e has increased by about two times since 2012.
5  Meanwhile, 
peer nations are focused on making substantially more mid- band spectrum available for licensed 
use, with access to 140 percent more licensed mid -band spectru m.6  That gap is expected to grow 
nearly 40 percent in the next five years absent a course-correction for U.S. spectrum policy.7   
B. Commercial  Wireless Licensees Have Built -In Incentives to Ensure Spectrum is 
Used Efficiently to Serve Business, Enterprise, and Consumer Needs .  
In granting the Commission authority to issue spectrum licenses via auction, Congress 
required the Commission to promote the public interest through several core objectives—

"4 including “achieving the most efficient use of spectrum.”8  Acquiring commercial wire less 
licenses at auction or in the secondary market comes with a multi- billion -dollar price tag and 
therefore does just that.  It triggers investment in highly efficient technologies and infrastructure 
that can maximize spectrum usage and efficiency .   
The U.S. wireless industry has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to acquire spectrum at 
auction and in the secondary market, as well as in capital investments for network buildout, to compete in the U.S. broadband market and achieve these important missions.  Commercial wireless service providers have invested more than $230 billion in spectrum auctions in the last 30 years—including nearly $120 billion in the last five years—to acquire licenses at auction to support their networks.
9  And this does not include the billions of dollars providers have invested 
in secondary market transactions.  In total, the U.S. wireless industry has invested more than $675 billion in its networks over the life of the industry, with a record-setting $39 billion invested in 2022 alone.
10   
Thus, when acquiring spectrum at auction or in the secondary market, commercial 
wireless providers are incentivized to put those assets to work by ensuring every megahertz of spectrum held is used as efficiently as possible to satisfy growing demands.  For example, the wireless industry enhanced efficiency in our nation’s wireless networks by 42-times from 2010-2019.

"5 are some of the most intensely used bands, with spectral efficiency increasing with each new 
generation of wireless technology supported by these voluntary standards.12  5G is expected to 
further increase spectral efficiency, with some estimates predicting a 52 -percent increase in mid -
band spectral efficiency.13   
Further , wireless  providers also “refarm” legacy spectrum to the extent possible to 
replace older technologies with advanced, more efficient services.14  And network slicing 
enables already efficient 5G networks to be used to deliver specialized offerings.  With network slicing, the radio resources of a single physical network can be efficiently shared so that multiple sets of users can access differentiated virtual networks with customized capabilities as needed to meet their individualized needs, including security, bandwidth, and latency, alongside traditional best-efforts mobile broadband.
15 
Given these incentives and efforts, t he Commission should recognize that the  commercial 
wireless licensing model generates tremendous spectrum usage and efficiencies . 
III. A MEASURED APPROACH IS RECOMMENDED FOR ANY COMMISSION 
ANALYSIS OF NON- FEDERAL SPECTRUM USAGE.  
As recognized in the NOI, past efforts to explore spectrum usage have concluded that a 
one-size- fits-all approach is not suited to our nation’s  spectrum environm ent given differences in 
technical and operational characteristics .16  Accordingly, to the extent the Commission seeks to 
evaluate tools for measuring spectrum occupancy or use, it should do so on a band- specific basis.

"6 The Commission should also focus an y investigation on non- auctioned spectrum bands , such as 
unlicensed, shared uses, and satellite, given they do not have the same incentives that are 
inherent to spectrum assigned via the auction licensing model .  Taking a considered approach to 
any such assessment will better enable interested stakeholders to engage meaningfully on the service- specific considerations within a designated frequency range.   
As the Commission also recognizes, spectrum usage data colle ction is not without costs 
and collection burdens .
17  Wireless providers invest  billions of dollars in capital expenditures to 
deploy and enhance their networks and  work constantly to ensure that the network meets 
consumer, enterprise, and government user needs .  As the data points above confirm, commercial 
licensed wireless providers have demonstrated their intensive use of licensed spectrum.  A ny 
inquiry should refrain f rom imposing onerous or unnecessary data collections on the commercial 
wireless industry.   
In addition, t he Commission recognizes  that there are inherent  data protection and 
security concerns associated with such an inquiry.18  These elements are particularly acute in the 
context of data that is held or collected by wireless providers in the course of their regular spectrum monitoring efforts.
19  Such data  can be  informative to providers’ commercially 
sensitive deployment plans and customer engagement strategies  and, if made public, could prove 
to be a roadmap for providers’ competitors  or put the networks themselves at risk.  The 
Commission should therefore recognize the nature of competitively - and security- sensitive

"7 information as it considers the potential for such data to inform the Commission ’s broader 
inquiry into non- federal  spectrum occupancy and use . 
In the context of considering more intensive spectrum use, it is important to also note that 
technological efficiencies or increased  wireless facility  site density cannot alone ensure sufficient 
spectrum resources are available to meet growing consumer and business demands.  Without 
further acti on to make additional licensed spectrum available in prime mid -band frequencies, the 
U.S. stands to see a more than 1,400-megahertz shortfall by 2032.20  Additional licensed 
spectrum is needed in the near term in the core mid-band frequencies to address projected growth and foster innovation.
21   
Finally, for the efficiencies associated with a licensed spectrum framework to continue, 
Congress must renew the Commission’s ability to conduct spectrum auctions.  As Chairwoman Rosenworcel has stated, the Commission’s “authority to auction the nation’s airwaves has been an indispensable tool for harnessing the promise of new wireless technologies while also spurring economic growth, creating jobs, and strengthening our national security and global leadership.”

"8 IV. CONCLUSION.  
The commercial wireless licensing model inherently compels licensees to ensure their 
spectrum assets are efficiently used.  The Commission should acknowledge this reality as part of 
any next steps in its spectrum usage inquiry while promoting actions that foster sound spectrum stewardship across our nation’s airwaves.

COMMENTS OF MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES INC.  
I. INTRODUCTION.  
Maxar Technologies Inc. (“Maxar”)  submits the following comments on the above -
referenced Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”).1  Maxar is the global leader in commercial remote sensing , 
with over 3.8 million square kilometers of high -resolution imagery collected each day .  As part of 
continually improving its customer offerings in this space, Maxar recently acquired Aurora Insight 
Inc.,2 a company that specializes in accurate, data -driven insights on radiofrequency (“RF”)  usage 
based on measurements of the RF environment worldwide. 
In the NOI , the Commission requests comment on data sources, technology, and methods  
to measure non- Federal spectrum usage and procedures to turn this data into ac tionable 
information , and Maxar’s experiences with RF environment measurements provide a unique 
perspective on these questions.  The FCC’s  existing data, while extensive, does not provide 
practical insight into real deployment and usage.  Conversely, moder n RF sensing satellites like 
Maxar’s, in conjunction with a larger ground- , aircraft -, and satellite -based system, can provide 
accurate and actionable data on non -Federal spectrum usage across many spectrum bands and use 
cases.

 II. MAXAR CAN PROVIDE UNIQUE AND VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO RF 
SPECTRUM USAGE USING THE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES OF MODERN RF SENSING SATELLITES . 
In the NOI, the Commission chiefly asks for comment regarding available spectrum 
monitoring tools, related challenges including cost, accuracy, and uniformity, and how spectrum 
monitoring data  might be best use d to inform policy.
3  As the agency  acknowledges, its existing 
data sources mainly provide information regarding spectrum allocations, authorizations, and other 
static characteristics, rather than having the capability to track more dynamic  usage.4  This static 
data provides valuable information across a number of dimensions, but it alone cannot address the 
“greater need to consider [actual spectrum usage] data to improve spectrum management”5 that 
accompanies the continued growth of RF congestion. 
Accurate and cost -effective tools to measure and analyze this data do exist, however.  
Maxar is now able both to provide highly accurate RF monitoring services globally through a 
combination of ground, aircraft, and satellite -based sensors and to map and analyze this data.   
Importantly, Maxar can image RF across a wide range  of frequencies,6 despite the diversity of 
spectral characteristics, and has experience serving bo th enterprise and public sector customers.   
Maxar’s data is also compatible with geospatial mapping tools to assist in more thorough analysis.  Maxar has, for example, monitored the change in Citizens Broadband Radio Service deployment 
by Verizon Wireless in Las Vegas, Nevada from July to November 2021 and helped to identify 
deployment and optimization opportunities.
7  Maxar has also measured periodic increases and

6 Maxar is currently able to measure usage in the range of 470 MHz to 40 GHz terrestrially and 
1.415- 10 GHz and 24- 40 GHz from space.  Future satellites, to be  deployed in 2025, will enable 
space- based measurements from 600 MHz to 40 GHz.

 decreases in Global Navigation Satellite System signal power emanating from the earth , allow ing 
government agencies and commercial organizations to understand when those services may be 
compromised  due to interference .8  The Commission asks whether RF monitoring can produce 
actionable insights,9 and these use cases and others demonstrate that i t can.  
Moreover, space- based RF monitoring provides unique benefits over other technologies 
and methods.  For example, RF -monitoring satellites allow for the assessment of spectrum use 
over the entire U .S. much more efficiently and cost -effectively than a terrestrial solution could.  
Moreover, satellites provide frequent revisits, which allow users to continually update their 
measurements.  This technology is also not limited by signal type and can measure spectrum use from GNSS, satellite systems, terrestrial mobile systems, and other networks .  Further, Maxar can 
identify and distinguish these varying signal types  using advanced signal processing, artificial 
intelligence, and machine learning (“ML”) technologies.
10  Using its massive historical repository 
of spectrum usage data, Maxar is able to create ML models that recognize different types of signals, 
even in extremely complicated co -channel and multipath environments .  Despite the robustness of 
the data, because this type of  satellite RF monitoring does  not include a geolocation capability, it 
does not implicate the same privacy issues that other solutions could.   If space- based monitoring 
does reveal an anomalous or unexpected result, air - or land -based monitoring can be deployed to 
gather additional da ta. 
The Commission also requests comment on how to “encourage or incentivize access” to 
data gathered by private monitoring,11 such as the data Maxar has gathered and analyzed on behalf

 of its customers.  Maxar would encourage the Commission to pursue a field monitoring pilot 
program as proposed by the Commission in partnership with both public and private entities.12  
Highly accurate and actionable RF monitoring tools like those used by Maxar exist in  the market 
and would create significant value in partne rship with the FCC in informing policy going forward.   
Indeed, such a pilot program could take advantage of the fact that Maxar’s satellites are already 
deployed and collecting data about spectrum use globally.  Maxar began collecting, storing, and 
analyzing data about global spectrum use in early 2020, enabling the Commission or other users 
to track the  changes that have occurred since that time .  Maxar’s  satellites can provide global 
updates at least weekly , and that cadence is increasing as Maxar continues to launch new satellites.   
This combination of existing infrastructure, longitudinal data, and versatile measurements would 
contribute unique value to a field monitoring pilot program and, more broadly, to the 
Commission’s and the public’s understanding of current spectrum usage —and how policy can 
encourage better and more efficient use.  
III. CONCLUSION. 
Maxar appreciates the Commission’s efforts to better understand non -Federal spectrum 
usage and agrees that there is “exciting potential to advance our understanding” of actual RF 
operations using innovative tools like Maxar’s.13  Maxar looks forward to working with the FCC 
on this proceeding.

COMMENTS OF THE GPS INNOVATION ALLIANCE  
 
The GPS Innovation Alliance (“GPSIA”) respectfully submits these comments in 
response to the Notice of Inquiry  (“NOI”) in the above -captioned proceeding.1  The premise of 
this proceeding is to advance the Commission’s understanding of non -Federal use of s pectrum, 
including through an assessment of how the Commission should define “spectrum usage,” 
whether there are band -specific considerations, and how to measure and access data that will 
better allow the Commission to improve spectrum management.   GPSIA  encourages the 
Commission , in examining tools that may be used to determine spectrum usage,  to consider  the 
unique characteristics  of the U.S.  Global Positioning System (“GPS”) and refrain from taking 
any action that would  inadvertently jeopardize its use .   
I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  
GPSIA was formed to protect, promote, and enhance the use of GPS and Global 
Navigation Satellite System (“GNSS”) technologies.  GPS/GNSS  receivers are used in myriad 
government, military, commercial, public safety, food security , and critical infrastructure 
applications.  GPSIA members and affiliates are drawn from a broad cross -section of the 
economy and represent a wide variety of fields and businesses whose billions of consumers are

"2 reliant on GPS  in U.S. and non -U.S. markets .  GPSIA includes organizations in the 
manufacturing, aviation, agriculture, construction, transportation, emergency response , 
surveying, mapping, and defense industries and organizations .  They represent  consumers who 
depend on GPS for boating and other ou tdoor activities, and in their automobiles, farm vehicles, 
smart phones, and tablets.  GPS is a highly innovative, successful, and ubiquitous technology 
that has injected $1.7 trillion into the nation’s economy2 and is critical to the smart infrastructure, 
services, and applications of today, tomorrow, and decades to come.  Studies show that the loss 
of GPS service would average a $1 billion per -day impact on the nation .3 
GPSIA recognizes and appreciates that ra diofrequency spectrum is a scarce resource that 
the Commission must manage in the public interest.  But simply analyzing data – however the 
data set is defined – is an ineffective way to measure spectrum usage  and represents one of the 
limitations of the C ommission’s proposed techniques to understand ing non-Federal spectrum 
usage .  It is critical that  the Commission consider  the varying service, operational, and technical 
characteristics of how spectrum is used to obtain an accurate picture and develop appr opriate 
policies .   
Specifically , the Commission should recognize that  there  are differences between 
navigation systems  like GPS and commercial communications systems  that necessitate different 
spectrum evaluations .  For example, devices that rely on GPS signals  are receive -only and have  
technical characteristics and use cases that are different from communications -centric services ,

"3 making evaluation of their use of sp ectrum using data alone difficult to achieve.  Moreover, there 
are billions of devices that rely on GPS, creating a volume of GPS receivers that is impractical – 
if not impossible – to measure.   
Any changes in spectrum policy that the Commission contempla tes making  based on its 
evaluation of spectrum usage must recognize that GPS devices are particularly affected by 
adjacent -band operations.   Indeed, the Commission has historically maintained a “quiet 
neighborhood” around spectrum used by GPS devices, and the Commission should maintain that 
approach.  The Commission must also ensure that any policies it adopts as a result of its 
spectrum usage assessment takes into consideration the large embedded user base of  GPS 
device s, many of which cannot be changed wi thout losing vital functionality.    
Finally, t he Commission should not adopt a receiver performance database in support of 
assessing spectrum use because of its administrative and financial infeasibility.  The better 
approach  to understand ing GPS spectrum usage  would be for  the Commission , in addition to 
taking the factors above into consideration,  to review  previous Executive decisions and actions 
by the  Department of Defense (“DOD”) to fully understand the purpose and operation of GPS 
devices as well as t heir importance to national security.  
II. THE COMMISSION SHOULD NOT ADOPT A  ONE -SIZE -FITS -ALL  
APPROACH TO EVALUATING SPECTRUM USAGE  
GPSIA wholeheartedly agrees  with a key finding from t he August 2014 Wireless 
Spectrum Research and Development ( “WSRD ”) Senior Steering Group  that “[t]here is not a 
one-size-fits-all approach to measuring spectrum usage.”4  The Commission should heed that

Spectrum Utilization  (Aug. 2014), https://perma.cc/EW5E -QYQ9 ( “2014 NITRD Workshop Report ”)).",4,GPSIA - Adv Understanding of Non Fed Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,THE GPS INNOVATION ALLIANCE,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 guidance, particularly with respect to GPS devices , which face unique challenges and require 
special considerations whe n it comes to determining their use of spectrum .  
A. Challenges in Measuring Spectrum Usage Identified in 2014 WSRD Report 
are Further Entrenched in 2023  
As an initial matter, t he NOI asks respondents to identify data -related challenges  – 
including data prote ction, privacy, and security  – to evaluating spectrum usage.5  The 2014 
WSRD report  noted that, “[r]ecognizing a fundamental tradeoff between spectrum efficiency and 
protection of privacy and security, challenges exist to ensure effectiveness of data while not 
revealing more than is necessary.”6  GPSIA agrees.  Some  companies allow users to “opt out” of 
sharing privacy related data and information, including GPS -driven location data, with third 
parties as a privacy protecting measure , limiting the abi lity to capture data regarding GPS -reliant 
devices .  The uses of emerging but still brittle  technologies such as artificial intelligence and 
machine learning to assess spectrum use can further exacerbate challenges created by privacy 
concerns .  Worse, their use can e rode public trust in the Commission  if they inaccurately 
measure spectrum use  due to the unpredictability of the technology, or expose information 
considered by the consumer to be private .7  Accordingly, the Commission should recognize that 
any attempts to gather data about the use of spectrum by GPS device  users  may result in 
imprecise or incomplete information.

"5 B. Measurement of Spectrum Use  Must Acknowledge that Radionavigation 
Systems are Different than Radiocommunications Systems   
In addition, i n measuring and assessing metrics to determine spectrum usage, the 
Commission must appreciate the distinctions between navigation systems and communications 
systems.  As navigation system s, GPS/GNSS operate fundamentally differently than radio 
communications systems, with  inherently different technical and functional attributes .  For 
instance, u nlike communications systems, which operate above the noise floor, spread spectrum 
GPS signals are below the thermal noise floor when they are received.  Moreover,  while 
communication s systems decode data bits, navigation systems measure the precise timing of bit 
transitions in order to derive precise timing and positioning information.  These sub -nanosecond 
measurements of bit edges require wide receiver bandwidth, which also aids in effective 
multipath rejection.  Most GNSS system receivers further rely on continuous tracking of the 
signal carrier of each satellite being tracked to attain maximum accuracy.8  And a ll GNSS 
receivers track the pseudo random noise code (“PRN  code”) from selected satellites in view, 
which is accomplished in the code tracking loop , which  synchronizes a locally generated replica 
PRN code with the PRN code broadcast  from the satellite  and allows the receiver to make a 
precise measurement of the s tarting edge of the first bit of the PRN code sequence as it repeats.   
GPS/GNSS receiver manufacturers have invested significant resources in research, 
development, testing , and evaluation to create receivers that can detect extraordinarily “quiet” 
signal s from the noise and continuously track the signals emitted by GPS satellites.  But even 
minor increases in the noise floor can impede the ability of GNSS receivers to extract signals 
 
8 By continuously tracking the carrier and measuring its phase at the time of measurement (the “carrier 
phase”), relative motion with respect to the satellites can be ascertained at sub -centimeter levels.  Lack of 
continuous carrier phase renders many high precision applications, such as surveying, precision 
agriculture, unmanned ai rcraft operations, and connected vehicle operations, unavailable.",6,GPSIA - Adv Understanding of Non Fed Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,THE GPS INNOVATION ALLIANCE,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"6 from the noise, thereby degrading performance .  Because m any receivers a re used in safety -of-
life applications , the Commission must consider  these fundamental differences in navigation and 
communications systems, as well as GPS use cases, in determining how to define, collect data  
about , and assess spectrum usage.  These diffe rences can impact the definition of “spectrum 
usage,” the data that is collected to measure spectrum usage, the selection of instruments used to 
collect that data, the measurements themselves, and any resulting assessments.  
If these differences are not taken into consideration, the Commission could develop an 
inaccurate picture of the spectrum needs of GPS users, which  may result in regulatory action that 
impacts their use.  Given the importance of GPS and GNSS to  safety -of-life, the domestic and 
global economies, critical infrastructure sectors, and the daily activities of individuals 
worldwide, the Commission’s efforts at spectrum management , including  measurement and 
assessment of spectrum usage,  must take these factors into account to ensure continued  
availability of signals that deliver critical information to services that rely on GPS.  To do so 
would put into practice the Commission’s recognition in the NOI “that there are special 
considerations with regard to public safety and critical infrastructu re needs.”9 
C. Measurement of Spectrum Allocated to GPS Must be Tailored to the Unique 
Aspects of GPS  
The Commission should further consider  the sheer volume of GPS receivers in the 
marketplace as an important measure of spectrum usage.   There can be little question that 
spectrum that supports GPS and GNSS devices is intensely employed.  In fact, worldwide, 
GNSS manufacturers have produced more than  six billion  GPS/GNSS receivers, and there are 
 
9 NOI ¶ 18.",7,GPSIA - Adv Understanding of Non Fed Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,THE GPS INNOVATION ALLIANCE,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7 currently well over  one billion  receivers cur rently in use in the U.S. alone.10  The spectrum 
allocated to GPS is used every day, at all times of the day, to support the myriad use cases that 
GPS receivers enable for consumers around the globe.  
It is also important to note that spectrum usage differ s for each GPS use case.  Some GPS 
receivers are always “listening” for GPS signals so that they can turn the signal into information 
that is combined with other sensor data to provide greater value to the consumer.  For example, 
systems that monitor and w arn first responders and the public of earthquakes, where data from 
seismometers is combined with GPS locational data, must rely on the continuous reception of 
GPS signals to operate and provide life -saving information  at unpredictable intervals in time .  
Others, such as GPS receivers embedded within emergency handsets, rely solely on GPS signals 
to deliver value and may be used  intermittent ly, and at times seasonal ly, but are extremely 
important in time-sensitive, safety -of-life critical moments , as recognized by the NOI.11   
To the extent possible, the Commission must take into consideration the myriad GPS 
devices available in the marketplace as well as the  continuity of the GPS signal required for 
those devices to operate properly.  Both are  important indicator s of GPS spectrum usage.

"8 III. MISAPPLYING SPECTRUM USAGE DEFINITIONS, TOOLS, 
MEASUREMENTS, AND ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORKS MAY LEAD TO 
ERRONEOUS  CONCLUSIONS  
The NOI invite s respondents to comment on “the appropriate size of the band segment 
for possi ble study.”12  Although the WSRD report  concludes that “[t] he services and operations 
of systems within a specific band drive the data needs and it use ” and “ spectrum monitoring and 
information development need to be band specific ,”13 band-specific monitoring alone is not 
sufficient , particularly with respect to the bands in which GPS devices receive signals .  Spectrum 
allocations within a band must also be measured differently , depending on its use .  For instance , 
differe nt types of  systems are licensed to operate within the L band  and adjacent spectrum in 
which GPS operates.  A ll of these must be taken into consideration, whether for radionavigation 
services such as GPS, wireless communications, or other communications services .  And an y 
definitions, tools, measurements, and assessment frameworks of spectrum usage must be 
specifically tailored for GPS given their distinctive differences.  Misapplying spectrum usage 
tools, and measurements designed for communications systems would result in incorrect 
assessments of GPS spectrum usage.   
A. The Commission Must be Mindful of Adjacent Bands when Considering the 
Applicability of Significant Changes to Spectrum Policies After Considering 
Spectrum Usage  
GPS/GNSS receivers have been optimized over the past 30 years and have been designed 
to block some signals outside their bands.  But it is unrealistic to expect all receivers to block all 
signals.  Size and cost constraints limit the abilit ies of receiver s to implement any and all types 
of mitigation.  And s ome improvements in receiver blocking come at the expense of receiver

"9 performance.   Sensitive receivers that by design capture faint signals (like GPS devices) may 
experience a degradation i n performance if they are forced to tolerate markedly stronger 
adjacent -channel signals, even if they are completely redesigned.   
In an acknowledgement of this reality, the Commission has historically maintained an 
appropriately quiet spectrum neighborhoo d – populated by similar spectrum users – for 
technologies that by design rely on faint radio signals and sensitive equipment, such as GPS 
receivers.  Maintaining this “quiet neighborhood” has not only been necessary to ensure the 
ability of GPS receivers to operate, but it also has created an efficient use of spectrum.   
Consistent with this approach, the Commission should ensure that any evaluation of 
spectrum usage consider the fact that use of spectrum adjacent  to GPS operations is – and should 
remain – limited to services that are compatible with GPS operations.  To hold otherwise could 
result in policies that allow the proliferation of users  with significantly different technical 
parameters  in spectrum adjacent to GPS.  For instance, if the Commission is erroneously led to 
believe that spectrum adjacent to GPS is “underutilized” simply because it was intentionally 
maintained to serve as a “quiet neighborhood,” the Commission could conclude that adjacent -
band spectrum can be licensed at greater power lev els, degrading the ability of GPS receivers to 
provide important services.  Given the many different examples of highly successful and near 
ubiquitous spectrum usage with very different technical characteristics, such as GPS, satellite 
radio, and low -power  unlicensed applications, it would be inappropriate for the Commission to 
evaluate spectrum usage of a particular device or service  without carefully considering all the 
spectrum, including adjacent -band, needs  of that device or service .",10,GPSIA - Adv Understanding of Non Fed Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,THE GPS INNOVATION ALLIANCE,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"10 B. The Commission Mu st Consider the Extent and Cost of Impacts to the 
Embedded User Base from New Services  
It is particularly important that the Commission accurately capture the spectrum use and 
therefore needs of GPS receivers because, a s the Commission recognizes, spectrum  management 
initiatives , including attempts to optimize spectrum usage,  may involve the modification or 
replacement of receive rs affected by its decisions .14  GPS receivers often have a very long useful 
life, and GPS -enabled  equipment can be highly integrated, with the GPS devices being only one 
component  of a system .  The re are also  numerous industry segments that depend on the reliable 
reception of GPS and have already invested many billions of dollars in their systems to p rovide 
critical devices and services requiring high reliability and integrity, including those used in 
public safety, safety -of-life, food security/ precision agriculture, and critical infrastructure 
environments.  In many instances, it may be impossible, i mpractical, or cost prohibitive to 
retrofit hardware, which may need to be retired and replaced well before the end of the 
equipment’s useful life  to comply with ill -advised regulatory mandates .  With six billion 
receivers in use today, the cost of replaci ng them based on ill -advised spectrum management 
directives , would exceed tens of billions of dollars . 
It is therefore vital that any policies developed because  of the Commission’s evaluation 
of spectrum usage take these factors into consideration.  M anufa cturers, consumers, and users of 
GPS devices may suffer significant lost investments that cause economic and market harms if the 
Commission fails to accurately evaluate their spectrum needs and/or forces them to alter their 
devices or uses to comply with C ommission policies based on an inaccurate evaluation.  T hat

"11 outcome would be clearly contrary to the public interest  and, in some instances, inconsistent with 
the spirit of the Commission’s digital equity agenda . 
IV. A RECEIVER PERFORMANCE DATABASE IS INAPPROPRIATE AND 
ADMINISTRATIVELY AND FINANCIALLY INFEASIBLE FOR DECOUPLED 
RECEIVERS  
The NOI asks questions about the practicality and efficacy of Commission spectrum 
usage databases  and other potential sources of data .15  While the number of GPS/GNSS rec eivers 
manufactured and used by consumers globally could be considered one measure of spectrum 
usage, GPSIA agrees with other parties that commented in response to a previous inquiry by  the 
Commission on whether it should establish a receiver database  that the Commission should not 
proceed with that approach.16  Such a database would be burdensome on licensees and present 
particularly difficult, if not insurmountable, challenges for decoupled receivers.   
Although GPS satellites are subject to extensive fed eral regulation, GPS receivers are 
decoupled from Commission licensing requirements and any centralized data collection process 
or mechanism.17  As such, there is no obvious way for the Commission to be able to collect 
detailed GPS receiver information that could populate a comprehensive database given the vast 
numbers of receivers manufactured and in use today.  It would therefore likely be 
administratively and financially infeasible to create a central source or mechanism to ca pture 
relevant data on the billions of devices that are in the hands of businesses and consumers across 
the U.S. today.  The data privacy, and security issues noted above would also be exacerbated, 
which should further discourage the use of spectrum usage databases.18  Like other commenters,

"12 GPSIA agrees that the Commission should not pursue a receiver performance  database .  And if 
the Commission  chooses to create such a database , it should not include decoupled receivers.  
V. IT IS ESSENTIAL  TO UNDERSTAND  THE  IMPORTANT  NATIONAL  GOALS  
ACHIEVED  BY ESTABLISHING  GLOBAL  PUBLIC  TRUST  IN THE  
INTEGRITY  OF GPS SIGNALS  
Finally, t he Commission should recognize that it has available a variety of tools – other 
than potentially incomplete, inaccurate , or misleading data metrics – to understand spectrum 
usage.  For instance, u nderstanding the history of systems, particularly the origins of public -
private partnerships grounded in government operated systems such as GPS, can provide  the 
Commission with im portant information about spectrum us ed by GPS .  Two Presidential policy 
decisions have played important  roles in determining how and for whom spectrum allocated to 
GPS should be used .   
First , the GPS program design  was approved and funded by the DOD in December 1973.19  
Although the DOD designed, developed, launched, and planned to integrate its capabilities into 
DOD operations, the system was also designed to support civil users.  On September 16, 1983, 
President R eagan’s administration announced that the United States would “make available to 
civilian aircraft the facilities of the Global Positioning System ” and that “[t] his system will 
provide civilian airliners three -dimensional positional information.”20  This d ecision followed the 
tragic September 1 downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , which had inadvertently navigated 
into Soviet Union airspace .  While President Reagan’s initial goal was to make air travel safe for

"13 the flying public, his policy decision also accelerated the development of a robust commercial 
GPS marketplace  – one that is thriving today.  
Second , after President Reagan’s announcemen t, the DOD determined it was in the 
national security interest to intentionally degrade GPS civil signals, in what was called “Selective 
Availability.”21  And, i n 2000, President Bill Clinton end ed the use of Selective Availability, 
bringing an immediate i mprovement in the horizontal and vertical accuracies of GPS:22 
 
This decision achieved another important national security goal:  establishing global 
public trust in the integrity of the GPS signal .  It also paved the way for numerous higher 
precision GPS -driven applications, such as precision agriculture, surveying, navigation, 
transportation, and many more.23  Briefly examining these decisions will offer the Commission 
greater insight into the usage  of spectrum by GPS as intended by our nation’s leaders  to achieve 
important national security and public safety goals that are still relevant today .

GPSIA appreciates that t he Commission has a long history of successfully managing the 
spectrum environment by grouping  similar  services together .  Tha t approach has maximized 
spectrum efficiency and allowed GPS, in particular, to become a globally -leading and 
ubiquitously  deployed technology  that enjoys the world’s trust in its signal integrity .  Continued

COMMENTS OF LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION 
 
 Lockheed Martin Corporation (“Lockheed Martin”) hereby responds to the Federal 
Communications Commission (“FCC” or “the Commission”) Notice of Inquiry (“ NOI”), Advancing 
Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage .1  
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
On August 23, 2023, the Commission initiated a proceeding intended to explore the potential to 
advance its understanding of non-Federal spectrum usage and “[leverage] today’s tools to understand how 
tomorrow’s commercial spectrum usage can help identify new opportunities to facilitate more efficient 
spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable co-existence among 
users and services.”2 Lockheed Martin commends the Commission for its efforts to bring next-generation 
techniques and data-driven analysis to its spectrum toolbox; and for its recognition that there is no one-
size-fits-all spectrum use definition, and that “infrequent use” is no indicator of a given service’s 
criticality.3 Lockheed Martin further commends the Commission for seeking to further co-existence 
among users and services; Lockheed Martin has elsewhere stressed that such co-existence is critical for 
the future of U.S. spectrum governance.4

 Lockheed Martin is participating in this proceeding as a global enterprise principally engaged 
in the research, design, development, manufacture, and integration of advanced-technology systems, 
products, and services for both commercial and government customers worldwide. As a result of much of 
its activity, Lockheed Martin is itself a Commission licensee and, accordingly, has extensive experience 
working with the FCC, as well as other U.S. Government (“USG”) agencies, on important issues of 
spectrum use. 
Lockheed Martin understands firsthand not only the importance of accurate spectrum use 
measurements, but also how the motivation for measurement— i.e., to “facilitate more efficient spectrum 
use”5—will directly influence how that use is defined. The myriad varied spectrum-dependent systems 
and technologies, and how those systems and technologies utilize spectrum, will necessarily require that 
spectrum use be examined on a service-by-service basis. The vast and varied number of products, 
systems, and services that Lockheed Martin provides offers valuable insights, as discussed below, into 
how the Commission may best define spectrum use. 
II. DEFINING SPECTRUM USE 
Lockheed Martin initially addresses the Commission’s stated intent of measuring non-Federal 
spectrum use: some of the below discussion centers around systems and technologies utilized by the USG 
in Federal bands, which may not appear immediately relevant to the NOI. However, as Lockheed Martin 
conducts the research, development, test & evaluation (“RDT&E”) and sustainment for these mission-
critical systems and technologies, they are also commonly operated on Commission-licensed non-Federal 
spectrum at Lockheed Martin facilities. Thus, for aerospace and defense (“A&D”) companies such as 
Lockheed Martin, non-Federal spectrum use is often inexorably linked to customers’ Federal spectrum 
use, as this intersection is where many A&D industry systems and technologies ultimately operate. 
Furthermore, A&D foreign military sales (“FMS”)6 tie A&D non-Federal spectrum use to spectrum 
requirements set forth by the U.S.’ foreign allies. Put differently, measurement of Lockheed Martin’s

"3 
 current non-Federal spectrum use is not a guaranteed indicator of its future spectrum use and 
requirements; similarly, measurement of others’ non-Federal spectrum use cannot, in and of itself, 
automatically assure the identification of new co-existence opportunities for Lockheed Martin—or the 
broader A&D industry—if those opportunities do not align with customer needs.  
A. There is no one-size-fits-all definition which appropriately characterizes spectrum use 
across the myriad varied spectrum-dependent services. 
 
Lockheed Martin agrees with similar past efforts which have concluded that there is no one-size-
fits-all definition for spectrum use,7 and recommends that the Commission develop a means to quantify 
spectrum use on a service-by-service basis. Whereas the spectrum use of some systems may benefit from 
measurement as a function of how often its output exceeds a certain threshold over a given timespan, as 
definitions referenced in the NOI suggest,8 this type of measurement is not appropriate for all systems. 
For example, Lockheed Martin manufactures critical national security radars with frequency hopping 
capabilities, which allow the radar system to avoid jamming and detection in order to meet its mission 
purpose: the need to preserve this mission capability means a radar is using its full bandwidth without 
always exceeding some predetermined output threshold.  
The NOI also asks how the design techniques noted in its Spectrum Policy Statement9 should 
affect spectrum use evaluation.10 Lockheed Martin does not believe these techniques, which are intended 
to “help satisfy performance and reliability expectations”, should be included in the Commission’s 
evaluation of spectrum usage. Given their intent, inclusion of these could result in de facto performance 
and reliability requirements—even though the Spectrum Policy Statement is non-binding.11 That is, 
services may feel compelled to adopt these design techniques if they wish for their spectrum use to be 
fully and appropriately measured, especially if that measurement could otherwise result in the deleterious

 (to the incumbent) reallocation of that spectrum. 
B. The Commission should reorient its goals around establishing a maximally shared spectral 
environment, as opposed to “efficiency”. 
 
Spectrum use is measured according to the measurer’s goal—which Lockheed Martin 
understands as facilitating more efficient use of the spectrum. “Efficiency” is not defined in the NOI—if 
the Commission intends to evaluate spectrum utilization on the basis of efficiency, that metric needs to be 
defined. Nonetheless, and echoing a similar finding from the Department of Commerce’s Spectrum 
Management Advisory Committee (“CSMAC”),12 Lockheed Martin offers that “efficiency” is too relative 
a term and not the right metric; instead, spectrum use should be measured consistent with the goal of 
establishing an effectively and maximally shared spectral environment, as the predicate to a spectrum co-
existence framework.  
The goal of increasing spectral efficiency suggests that spectrum use will be measured in 
quantitative terms, though quantitative data alone do not reveal whether spectrum is maximally used. 
Indeed, the Commission states, “[w]e note, for example, that several bands may exhibit infrequent usage 
that are nonetheless mission critical for their intended uses…”.13 Maintaining spectrum availability to, for 
instance, ensure that national security radars can be tested and calibrated to their Federally-mandated 
specifications may not be seen as “efficient” spectrum use by some, though it may nonetheless mean that 
a given band’s use has been maximized. Relatedly, the qualitative features of a given service should also 
factor into how spectrum use is measured, as the public good derived from certain services is not easily 
distilled into quantitative metrics. Furthermore, exclusive reliance upon quantitative metrics would 
entirely bypass the public safety and national security considerations of how such critical systems use 
spectrum to meet their defined missions. As the FCC’s Technical Advisory Committee (“TAC”) 
previously concluded, “Just as counting the number of cars on a highway is not the only measure of a 
road’s value, efficiency is not the only consideration when it comes to re-evaluating spectrum.”14

"5 
 Should the Commission choose to continue framing its goals in terms of spectrum efficiency, 
Lockheed Martin believes it would be helpful to clarify how measuring spectrum use will contribute to 
this determination, i.e., does the Commission intend to measure the aggregate spectrum use (however 
defined) in a given band to determine whether the whole band is being employed in a sufficiently efficient 
manner, or does it instead intend to determine whether a specific incumbent is utilizing its authorized 
spectrum—whether licensed or unlicensed—in a sufficiently efficient manner. Lockheed Martin disagrees 
with the latter approach: defense platforms are generally designed to use only as much spectrum as 
necessary to ensure optimal performance and mission success. In this way, platform designs are already 
effectively efficient. Lockheed Martin also notes that, from a market perspective, there is no economic 
incentive for A&D systems to occupy more spectrum than necessary to complete the given mission, and 
further, that such requirements are set by the Federal customer, whose program and mission needs are 
already subject to Executive Branch and Congressional oversight. In addition, integral to the function of 
these systems is a design suited for the spectral environment in which it will be required to operate, itself 
a function of both the allocated service spectrum and adjacent band operations.  
C. Responses to specific questions posed in the NOI.  
 
1. Time. 
 
The Commission asks, “With respect to time usage, could hourly, daily, or seasonal variations 
affect conclusions about spectrum usage.”15 Lockheed Martin offers an example of how time plays a 
critical role in how operations are conducted, but could distort the absolute objective of measuring 
spectrum usage. Lockheed Martin’s Liverpool and Cazenovia, NY facilities, in partial economic areas 
(“PEA”) 41, 44, and 227 which conduct radar RDT&E and sustainment in the 3.45-3.525 GHz, currently 
operate under a special temporary authority (“STA”) which limits Lockheed Martin’s high-power 
RDT&E operations to between midnight and 8 AM16—the time of spectrum measurement will impact the

Radiolocation Service Sites in the 3.45 GHz Band , Order, ULS File No. 0009581172, DA 21-693 
(rel. June 16, 2021) (“STA Order”); see also ULS Call Sign WRMX417.",4,LMCO Non-Federal NOI Response vF.pdf,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 results derived. Likewise, as this requirement is a function of conditions outlined in Lockheed Martin’s 
current authority, that authority is expected to evolve over time; future spectrum utilization decisions for 
these PEAs—informed by spectrum use—should thus recognize that Lockheed Martin’s current restricted 
use is not necessarily reflective of its future use. Further, these operational requirements, which will 
materially impact any quantitative measure of spectrum use, require specific knowledge of FCC-imposed 
requirements—again highlighting how quantitative data alone cannot tell the full spectrum use story.  
2. A holistic understanding of the spectrum landscape. 
 Lockheed Martin is pleased to see that the Commission inquires whether spectrum usage can be 
combined to generate a holistic understanding of the spectrum landscape.17 Geography will play an 
important role in any holistic understanding. For example, the radars Lockheed Martin conducts RDT&E 
and sustainment for in the PEAs also operate in Cooperative Planning Areas (“CPA"") and Periodic Use 
Areas (“PUA”).18 Radars within the CPAs and PUAs are afforded greater operational flexibility than 
those in the cited PEAs, thus the Commission could not extrapolate from PEA data the spectrum use of 
the same radar systems elsewhere located ( e.g., in the CPAs and PUAs).  
 To develop a holistic understanding of the spectral environment, and while the Commission does 
not suggest in the NOI that it seeks to preclude certain non-Federal use from measurement, Lockheed 
Martin encourages the Commission to focus its efforts not only on bands that might be candidates for 
repurposing, but also on the existing spectrum allocations of any service seeking to expand its allocations, 
especially when that desired access is as licensed, exclusive use. The Commission should measure 
whether such non-federal spectrum allocations are maximized in use, including from a geographic 
perspective, as such measurements may inform future decisions on the size of spectrum blocks to be 
licensed. Lockheed Martin further emphasizes that no licensing method, such as exclusive license 
auctions, should be presumed to have resulted in maximized use as a matter of fact.

Martin’s STA covers the 3.45-3.525 GHz section only. See STA Order.",5,LMCO Non-Federal NOI Response vF.pdf,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 3. Standardization. 
 Lockheed Martin questions whether standardization of data sources, measurement methodologies, 
and equipment19 would best allow the Commission to develop a holistic understanding of spectrum use. 
In particular, Lockheed Martin remains concerned that any attempt by the Commission to standardize 
data broadly across all services may fail to account for important differences across those services and 
could potentially introduce unintended bias into the Commissions’ measurements. Unless wholly new 
standardized data sources, measurement methodologies, and equipment are developed, the standardization 
baseline would be grounded in existing data, methodologies, and equipment developed for a specific 
service—allowing for the favorable measurement of that service relative to others. In short, Lockheed 
Martin believes the Commission should study spectrum use based on the licensing and usage 
characteristics of all users in a given band, as opposed to adopting a broad, standardized approach.  
4. Artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
Lockheed Martin agrees that artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) offer 
promise in evaluating big datasets20 and providing the USG with insights into spectrum use over time, 
spectral band, and geography. One likely significant challenge to the leveraging of AI/ML, however, is 
the sensing of spectrum consistently; while AI/ML techniques work well when there exists an abundance 
of data from a suite of homogeneous sensors, they can struggle to handle different datasets from highly 
diverse sensors, e.g., handheld devices and satellite sensors, which have dramatically different fields of 
view. AI/ML techniques may also be undermined by biased data, such as sensors and datasets which 
focus on population centers, but contain minimal data for low population density areas or maritime 
environments. Lockheed Martin thus recommends that a combination of terrestrial and space-borne 
sensors be utilized, as this will allow for a better understanding of spectrum usage at scale, globally.  
To maintain cost effectiveness, the Commission should consider issuing a request for proposal or 
request for information related to the commercial provision of such sensor data. Proliferated low earth

 orbit (“LEO”) satellite communications (“SATCOM”) operators are likely best suited for such a 
capability, as they offer consistency in terms of orbit, and would require a simpler sensor due to size of 
the constellations and their geometric diversity. Similar opportunities may be present within the 
Department of Defense and in partnership with organizations such as the U.S. Space Force’s Space 
Development Agency, though these datasets may require exclusive USG use.  
D. Space-Based Operations. 
As the Commission well knows, RF technology and global competition for spectrum are 
accelerating. Some of today’s most widely used consumer technologies leverage unlicensed spectrum 
(e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) by incorporating practical, low-cost means of operating in heavy interference 
environments, and similarly controlling their own emissions to avoid interference. Spectrum sharing and 
co-existence among users has naturally evolved in such a competitive spectral environment, and, as a 
result, these bands are highly utilized in terms of time, spectrum, and geographic utilization. Lockheed 
Martin believes similar reserved and smartly regulated spectrum bands can foster future innovation in the 
space environment—and thus emphasizes that spectrum decisions resultant from spectrum use 
measurement should not result exclusively in the reallocation of spectrum for auction. While certain 
systems will likely continue to utilize exclusive-use spectrum for their services, it is equally important to 
reserve spectrum—including shared—for the fostering of additional space-based services and the 
commercialization of space. Such bands may appear to be used less intensively than others, though they 
are nonetheless important to maintaining the U.S.’ role as a global leader in space.  
Additionally, the expansion of LEO SATCOM systems has highlighted the challenges in 
managing spectrum across multiple orbital regimes—LEO, medium-earth orbit, and geostationary orbit 
(“GEO”)—across both geography and spectrum. From a satellite operator perspective, a LEO and GEO 
system will contend with daily unintended interference from other operators in other orbits. While such 
interference can be regulated ( e.g., requiring that LEO operators not interfere with GEO systems, etc.), 
these interference events are incredibly challenging for operators that experience interference as well as 
for regulators to consistently detect and enforce. Such, and all other interference, scenarios raise",7,LMCO Non-Federal NOI Response vF.pdf,LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 
 important questions of how and, indeed, whether the Commission intends to ensure that interference into 
a given band is not measured as a given band’s use. 
III. CONCLUSION  
Lockheed Martin commends the Commission for seeking to advance its understanding of non-
Federal spectrum use and recognizing the importance of spectral co-existence. Lockheed Martin thus 
asserts that (i) there is no one-size-fits-all definition of spectrum use, (ii) ensuring a maximally shared 
spectrum environment is more appropriate than determining “efficient” use; and (iii) spectrum use must 
incorporate qualitative information, as opposed to relying on quantitative measures alone, which are 
unable to capture certain critical information about spectrum use. Lockheed Martin looks forward to 
working with the Commission on this important effort.

COMMENTS OF SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES CORP.  
SpaceX strongly supports the Commission’s goal in this Notice of Inquiry  to understand 
“how to better obtain more sophisticated knowledge of non -Federal spectrum usage  . . . to facilitate 
more efficient spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable 
co-existence among users and services .”1  With higher -fidelity information about how licensees 
use spectrum today , the Commission can better tailor its policies to promote the  productive use of 
spectrum  and enable  greater competition and higher -quality service  for consumers.  
To maximize the public interest benefits of this proceeding and set a strong foundation for 
global leadership  in 6G —which will include both terrestrial and satellite technologies —the 
Commission should study both terrestrial and satellite spectrum usage .  Assessing satellite 
spectrum usage is particularly important in lower -frequency bands , where satellite s will 
interweave with and compl ement terrestrial networks through both standalone  mobile -satellite 
service ( “MSS ”) and supplemental coverage capabilities .2

 Further, while  machine learning and artificial intellig ence could  play a role in spectrum 
management  at some point in the future , automation  of the Commission ’s regulator y functions  
should be the last step in improving spectrum management  policies , not the first.  Instead , the 
Commission should begin by leveraging simple,  low-tech processes that can p assively monitor 
spectrum usage without the need for complex, real -time systems .  For example , the Commission 
could  adopt  light-licensing  databases  in mi llimeter -wave frequency bands  that accommodate co-
primary  terrestrial and satellite  services .  These “unified ” light-licensing databases not only would 
provide a cost -effective, accurate, scalable, and actionable  means  of assessing spectrum usage  on 
a near -real-time basis , they also  would  simplif y licensing , speed  coordination , and promote rapid  
deployment  of innovative service s. 
Assess  satellite spectrum usage  alongside  terrestrial spectrum usage .  To best advance 
the goals of this proceeding  and fundamental Commission spectrum policies , the Commission  
should ensure that any assessment  of spectrum usage  includes  both terrestrial and  satellite services .  
Including both terrestrial and satellite spectrum usage would advance spectrum policy in several 
ways.  For example, 6G wireless networks will interweave both terrestrial and satellite networks 
in a si ngle, ubiquitous consumer experience , which will rely in  large  part on high -value low-
frequency mobile and MSS spectrum.  And yet, serious questions remain about whether and to 
what extent  current MSS licensees have made productive use of th eir long -standing spectrum 
holdings .3  By investigating spectrum usage in these MSS bands and taking appropriate 
interventions to facilitate new entry and efficient sharing, the Commission can ensure that these 
essential bands meaningfully advance 6G conne ctivity  and benefit American consumers .

only require  a small sl iver of their available capacity ).",1,SpaceX Spectrum NOI Comments (AS-FILED).pdf,SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGIES CORP,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 
 Including satellites in the Commission’s spectrum usage assessment s will also help 
improve  coordination and coexistence between co -primary t errestrial  and satellite operators  in 
higher -frequency  millimeter -wave bands .  Terrestrial and satellite operators share a number of 
millimeter wave frequency bands, such as the Ka -, Q/V -, and E -bands, as well as even higher 
frequency bands identified in the Commission’s Spectrum Frontiers proceeding.   Operations in 
these  millime ter-wave  bands fea ture high ly directional and “pencil beam ” links  that enable rapid 
self-coordination and efficient coexistence  between services .  Unfortunately, because terrestrial  
and satellite services  have separate licensing regimes and licensing databases,  assessing relative 
spect rum usage can be an unnecessarily difficult and time -consuming process.  Th ese challenges  
in turn can lead to overly cumb ersome  sharing  rules , delays in coordination,  and less efficient use 
of spectrum.   Fortunately, as explained in more detail below, the C ommission can readily expand 
existing, successful frameworks  to provide greater insights into spectrum usage across service 
types in millimeter -wave bands  while advancing fundamental spectrum policies .  
Improve and expand light -licensing “ link registration ” databases  to as sess terrestrial 
and satellite  spectrum usage in shared millimeter -wave frequency  bands .  The Commission can 
dramatically impro ve its ability to measure spectrum usage by establishing “unified” light -
licensing databases  that build upon existing solutions  and accommodate co-primary terrestrial an d 
satellite services  across a variety of share d millimet er-wave frequency  bands .4   
Twenty years a go, the Commission adopted its pioneering light -licensing framework for 
fixed service links in the 70/80/90 GHz band.5  This framework combine s a nationwide, non -

 exclusive license with a requirement to register individual fixed service links in a shared th ird-
party database.  The database —which is publicly accessible —contains technical information about 
individual  fixed  links that not only provides a picture of how operators are using the band , but also 
facilitates rapid self -coordination without the need f or individual site -by-site licensing in most 
circumstances .6  While the current 70/80/90 GHz database only supports f ixed service links, 
Comsearch, the primary 70/80/90 GHz third -party database manager, has explained that it can 
expand  the light-licensing database  into a “unified ” model to accommodate  other co -primary 
services —including satellite gateway earth stations, maritime links, and ground stations for 
stratospheric and aeronautical platforms —with only “minor,” “straightforward” changes to the 
existing database .7  And the  record in the ongoing 70/80/90 GHz modernization proceeding 
demonstrates strong support for this unified  approach.8   
Adopting a  unified light -licensing database model  across a n array of millimeter -wave 
spectrum  bands  would meaningfully advance the  Commission’s goal  in the NOI to “obtain more 
sophisti cated knowledge of non -Federal spectrum usage” in a cost -effective, scalable, accurate , 
and actionable manner.9   
A unified  light-licensing database  is a cost-effective  way to collect spectrum usage data  
across terrestrial and satellite uses because —as explained above —it would require little additional 
                                                 
6  In this way, light-licensing d atabases strike a  cost-effective  balance between simpl e, legacy  “snapshot-in-time” 
Commission databases and dynamic spe ctrum access systems .  See NOI ¶¶ 5-6.

 work to expand  the existing  system to accommodate additional co-primary services .10  Moreover, 
a light-licensing database framework  can more efficiently collect information than active  spectrum  
monitoring because it relie s on information that licensees provide in to the database , rather than 
time-intensive field tests or complex simulations and mo dels.  Moreover, because private third -
parties man age the databases , they can update them  more quickly  and cost -effectively  than the 
Commission  can update its internal licensing databases  for these purposes .  And unlike complex, 
dynamic spectrum access  systems  that require significant cost, engineering , and real-time data, 
light-licensing databases  require little more than  a simple online form, database , and  interference 
analysis algorithm to assess spectrum usage  and facilitate self -coordination .11 
The light-licensing database model can also readily  scale to accommodate a variety of 
shared millimeter -wave bands  beyond the 70/80/90 GHz band  without the need to build new, 
bespoke tools for each band .12  For example , industry stakeholders  including Comsearch  have 
strongly advocated  for the Commission to adopt a light-licensing database m odel for the  Q/V 
band .13  The Commission could also adopt a  similar light-licensing and link registration model for 
frequency bands above 90 GHz , which have similar propagation characteristics to the 70/80/90 
GHz band.  A light-licensing database  model could  also enable higher -fidelity  spectrum usage 
information in upper -microwave flexible use bands that terrestrial and satellite operators share ,

 enabling more efficient coordination and sharing .14  Interna tionally , the Italian regulator Agcom 
adopted a database model in the 28 GHz band to better understand terrestrial deploym ent and to 
facilitate efficient coordination with satellite gateway s.15 
The unified light -licensing database approach also would provide accurate and near -real-
time information  about network deployments, particularly when paired with policies to promote 
“database hygiene.”16  Further, adopt ing a common unified light -licensing database model  across 
multiple  millimet er-wave  frequency bands  and service types would help standardize data sources  
and measurem ent methodologies  to facilitate robust analysis within and across bands .17  And this 
model  would s erve as a marked improvement over existing, disparate Commission application and 
licensing forms . 
Expanding the existing  light-licensing database model to accommodate multiple  co-
primary services and additional millimeter -wave frequency bands is also actionable.  For example, 
the Commission could  act on several outstanding proceedings where the record supports adopting 
a new or expanded light -licensing database model.18  Similarly, the Commission could work with 
existing third -party spectrum coordinators —who also manage spectrum databases —to begin 
populating  database s for  other shared millimeter -wave bands  using existing  static  Commission  
databases , such as the Unified Licensing System and In ternation al Communications Filing Sy stem .

 Importantly, the light -licensing model has limits , and no “one -size-fits-all” model for 
spectrum usage assessment exists for all non -Federal bands .19  For example, lower frequency bands 
with less -directional propagation characteristics —such as mobile and mobile -satellite service 
bands —are not well -suited for the light-licensing database  model.  Similarly, frequency bands 
where operators receive blanket licenses and deploy millions of ubiquitous , portable,  or moving 
terminals —such as the Ku -band —present both practical  challenges and proprietary concerns that 
would make a publ ic light-licensing database  model unworkable.   Nevertheless, adopting a unified  
light-licens ing model in millimeter -wave bands would allow the Commission to meaningfully 
advance the goals of this proceeding  across wide swaths of spectrum  that have become 
increasingly import ant for both terrestrial and satellite network s to deliver robust services to 
American consumers.  
CONCLUSION  
By collecting more accurate information about how licensees —including satellite 
licensees —use limited and shared spectrum resources, the Commission can design spectrum 
policies that more effectively  promote  the public interest and set the stage for 6G leadership .  But 
before considering complex and novel  tools to assess spectrum usage, the Commission should first 
leverage and expand existing tools that have proven cost -effective, accurate, scalable, and 
actionable.  “Light licensing” link registration databases provide one such popular example, which 
could be expanded across a wide range of millimeter wave spectrum bands and use cases, including 
both terrestrial and non -terrestrial ground equipment.

"Before the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Washington DC, 20554   In the Matter of )   )  Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal ) WT Docket No. 23-232 Spectrum Usage )   )   Comments of Professor Monisha Ghosh, University of Notre Dame  I submit these comments in response to the Commission’s Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, a timely and much needed reevaluation of how spectrum usage can be measured using recent advancements in tools and methodologies. I am a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and a member of the Wireless Institute at the University of Notre Dame1. I am also the Policy Outreach Director for SpectrumX, the nation’s first Spectrum Innovation Center funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF)2. The views expressed here are mine and do not necessarily represent those of my affiliated institutions.  (1) Introduction While non-federal spectrum is allocated by the Commission for various services, actual utilization and occupancy is not currently tracked in a scalable fashion over space and time. As the demands on commercial uses of spectrum increase, from satellite, terrestrial mobile, Wi-Fi, public safety and other services, it is important to understand how well current non-federal allocations are being utilized in different geographies. One cannot control or manage what is not measured: hence, long term spectrum planning requires measurements and data on actual spectrum usage beyond mere spectrum allocations. However, careful thought needs to be put into how to define spectrum occupancy, what should be measured and how, managing the volume of data that will result from measurement campaigns and how such measurements can be used in crafting effective spectrum policy. I will present my comments on these topics, based on recent research conducted by my group. The above statements also apply to federal bands, but my comments will be restricted to spectrum measurements in non-federal bands.  1 https://wireless.nd.edu/ 2 https://www.spectrumx.org/",0,Monisha Ghosh_comments_WTB 23-232.pdf,Professor Monisha Ghosh,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"(2) Defining Spectrum Occupancy The NOI uses the terms “usage”, “utilization” and “occupancy” interchangeably. However, depending on the type of service, these terms could have different interpretations. For example, broadcast television channels, by the very nature of their services, always “occupy” the band they are allocated to since the transmissions are always on, but “utilization” or “usage” (we use these two terms interchangeably) should be a function of how many receivers actually tune in to the channel. Similarly, cellular base-stations (BSs) always transmit synchronization signals on their licensed channels, hence “occupy” the channel, but “usage” and “utilization” should be measured by how many users are actually connected on that frequency. On the other hand, public safety applications might occupy and utilize their allocations very differently from other services. Differentiating between occupancy and utilization requires advanced measurement techniques beyond RF sensing that can extract system-specific information for a deeper understanding: e.g., how many resource blocks (RBs) are allocated on a particular channel in a cellular network, or how many users are connected to a Wi-Fi access point (AP). Fortunately, such parameters can be extracted from many commercial wireless systems today using easily available tools, making both occupancy and utilization measurements possible without the need for expensive network monitoring equipment. It is important to quantify both occupancy and utilization separately: occupancy measurements can be used to verify whether systems are being deployed in frequencies that have been allocated to them and utilization measurements will indicate how well the allocated frequencies are being used.   (3) How should spectrum be measured?  Non-federal bands that deploy systems with open physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) protocols, such as cellular systems and public safety services based on 3GPP specifications and Wi-Fi based on the IEEE 802.11 family of standards can use methods beyond just RF sensing to determine utilization. For example, Wi-Fi beacons transmitted by a particular AP may include detailed information about that AP, such as frequency of operation, channel bandwidth, transmit power, SSID (service set identifier), BSSID (basic service set identifier), maximum transmit/receive rates, channel utilization (percentage of time the channel is sensed to be busy) and number of stations connected to the BSSID. A user device that receives this beacon will also calculate the RSSI (Receive Signal Strength Indicator), along with GPS and timestamps. These metrics can be easily retrieved from Android smartphones, as has been demonstrated by SigCap3. SigCap was recently  3 SigCap: https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~muhiqbalcr/sigcap/",1,Monisha Ghosh_comments_WTB 23-232.pdf,Professor Monisha Ghosh,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"used in a detailed study of 6 GHz performance4 that quantified the distribution and nature of RSSI received outdoors from a dense deployment of low-power-indoor (LPI) Wi-Fi 6E APs deployed in 6 GHz. Such an analysis provides deeper insights into utilization and occupancy than can be obtained just by RF sensing: the tools to perform these in-depth measurements and analyses are easily available today.  Similarly, our research on cellular systems using SigCap along with other smartphone-based tools such as QualiPoc5 have provided deep insights into, for example, CBRS and C-band deployments and potential for interference6. QualiPoc provides detailed information on channel aggregation, beamforming modes, RB allocation, RSRP (Reference Signal Received Power), RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality), BLER (Block Error rate) etc. which allows an in-depth analysis of utilization that is not possible with RF sensing. Other sensing devices, for example thinkRF7 and PRiSM8 can also be used to extract detailed information: our current research into spectrum utilization is using these tools as well. Some speedtest apps, such as the FCC Speedtest App, also extract limited information about the network beyond RF sensing.  An added benefit of system specific measurements is the ability to perform propagation and clutter analysis in real-world environments. Since smartphone-based tools provide Physical Cell ID (PCI) information of cellular base-stations along with RSSI measured at the user device, with sufficient data, one can build realistic models even in mmWave channels9 without requiring expensive channel sounding equipment.  Clearly, such tools cannot be applied to sense spectrum bands where proprietary systems are deployed. This is the case for many proprietary satellite systems, for example. Further, such tools (e.g., QualiPoc and PRiSM) may be more expensive than RF sensing and hence cannot be widely  4 S. Dogan-Tusha, M. I. Rochman, A. Tusha, H. Nasiri, J. Helzerman and M.

"deployed. Low-cost RF sensors such as RadioHound10 permit wider deployment and general-purpose spectrum measurements based on signal strength but cannot deliver detailed network information. Hence, judicious sensing architectures that employ all of the different measurement devices available today are required for sensing non-federal spectrum bands. Sensing tools and methodologies will also need to be band specific to account for service type deployed in the band.  (4) Sensing architectures As described above, there are a variety of different ways that non-federal spectrum bands can be measured. Some of the tools available today are deployed as fixed sensors whereas others can be mobile. The advantage of a fixed sensor node, such as thinkRF, is that spectrum can be monitored 24/7, allowing longitudinal analyses in time, but the measurement will only apply for a small area where the sensor is located. Fixed sensor networks are similar in that they will only be able to sense the local environment. Fixed approaches may not work, for example, in understanding how CBRS spectrum is being used since CBRS being a low-power system can only be sensed in the area where it is deployed. On the other hand, mobile sensors, such as the smartphone apps described above, allow spectrum to be monitored over a wider area with just a few devices: a phone can even be mounted on a drone to take aerial signal measurements as was done in our 6 GHz studies. Our recent research into CBRS deployments in and around South Bend, using a few smartphones with SigCap, speedtest apps, QualiPoc and PRiSM, revealed fairly intensive use of the spectrum, both by private wireless operators and a major cellular provider. While the Spectrum Access System (SAS) can also provide this data, it is not openly available, and furthermore, cannot be used easily to identify potential interference. The recent NTIA report on CBRS11 while comprehensive in the analysis of numbers of CBSDs authorized, needs to be enhanced with actual spectrum utilization measurements in order to build a complete picture of how spectrum sharing in the CBRS band is evolving so that the lessons learnt can be applied appropriately to other bands being considered for sharing in the future. This can only be done by targeted measurements such as described above.  However, in order to collect longitudinal data, such measurement campaigns need to be conducted periodically, which incurs cost. This approach is similar to drive tests conducted occasionally by  10 RadioHound, https://wireless.nd.edu/research/radiohound-a-low-cost-spectrum-sensor-2/  11 D, Boulware, A Romaniello, R. L. Dorch and M. G.

"cellular operators, but with the tools available today can also be conducted by university researchers. An example of such a research project is Broadband MAP US12, where students at various member institutions in SpectrumX collect measurements using SigCap and FCC Speedtest to analyze utilization of cellular and unlicensed frequencies. Such projects have the added benefit of engaging young students in the process of collecting and analyzing spectrum data.  True “crowdsourcing” where anyone can use the apps or purpose-built sensors to collect and submit spectrum data is also a possibility, but care has to be taken to maintain privacy of the individual(s) submitting such data. This may limit the usefulness of the data. Hence in our research we have focused on purposeful data collections using mobile devices, where the routes traversed to collect data do not divulge personal details of the data collector. With the availability of smartphone-based tools, such data gathering can be carried out at a community level as well.  (5) Data considerations No matter how spectrum data is collected, maintaining and curating datasets requires an investment in data infrastructure, developing formats and meta-data that add to the value of the measurements. Many of the apps mentioned above store data in JSON, which is easily converted to csv file formats for analysis. Data collected from standardized systems usually follow the specifications of the system, e.g., RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI for cellular systems and RSSI for Wi-Fi. Along with timestamps and GPS coordinates, these standardized metrics offer a uniform way to collect spectrum measurements. Data visualization and analysis of such data can be done by tools such as ArcGIS.  (6) Field Monitoring Pilot system There have been multiple past and ongoing efforts in pilots for spectrum monitoring. In 2021, the FCC conducted a pilot with the US Postal Service (USPS) where smartphones with SigCap and speedtest apps along with RadioHound sensors were mounted in USPS vehicles and automatically collected data on cellular and Wi-Fi systems during regular postal delivery routes13. This pilot concept was also implemented by the city of South Bend in 2022 – 2023, where phones running  12 Broadband MAP US, https://www.spectrumx.org/  13 Report to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/report-congress-usps-broadband-data-collection-feasibility-05242021.pdf",4,Monisha Ghosh_comments_WTB 23-232.pdf,Professor Monisha Ghosh,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"SigCap and FCC Speedtest were deployed in city garbage trucks and coverage maps generated14. The data from the phones in the garbage trucks, along with other measurements captured by students at the University of Notre Dame was recently used to create a coverage map of Wi-Fi 6E shown below. It should be noted that collecting these measurements using phones mounted in garbage trucks with apps that continually gathered data, did not require an extensive deployment of sensors and demonstrates that with easily available tools and simple methodologies, one can generate meaningful coverage results quickly and accurately. 
 In addition to RSSI, the data mapped above also contains information on how many unique BSSIDs were measured, what channel frequencies and bandwidths were being used etc. For cellular, detailed information on channels used, PCI, RSRP, RSRQ etc. were collected. We recommend that the FCC build on its own pilot program with the USPS and develop a targeted pilot system for monitoring which can leverage some of these approaches as a proof of concept that can be then used for wider deployment. All data collected through such pilots should be made available openly to the community.  (7) Conclusions Monitoring of spectrum bands is crucial to developing an understanding of how spectrum is actually being utilized today. This will inform future spectrum policy that seeks to increase utilization, not just occupancy, perhaps by sharing between different services. We recommend that the FCC investigate methods that go beyond RF sensing for those bands and systems, such as cellular and Wi- 14 South Bend Mobile Data Project, https://southbend.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/portfolio/index.html?appid=035e803261924a98ad5030df1f1ad3eb",5,Monisha Ghosh_comments_WTB 23-232.pdf,Professor Monisha Ghosh,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Fi, where tools and devices exist to ex tract detailed signal information beyond signal strength, 
combined with RF sensing in bands where signal structure is unknown. While the NOI focused on 
non-federal bands, it is also essential that federal bands be measured15 since sharing often involves 
federal systems such as radar and passive systems. As the FCC seeks to create more opportunities for 
new applications, current allocations and usage need to be studied in greater detail in all bands.

"Page 2 of 14 Alignment with the SpectrumX Purpose, Vision, and Plans  SpectrumX welcomes the FCC’s Notice of Inquiry (NOI) into state-of-the-art tools and capabilities to better understand utilization of the radio spectrum.  Among a number of important questions, the NOI asks, “[C]an we leverage the NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative and its connection to university researchers to conduct measurements and report back to us in some standard format or database?” SpectrumX’s answer to this question is a resounding “YES!”  A distinguishing feature of the NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative (SII) is the fact that the FCC, the NTIA, and the NSF entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to “facilitate sharing of NTIA and FCC subject matter expertise to help ensure that NSF SII investments in spectrum research, infrastructure, and workforce development are in alignment with U.S. spectrum regulatory and policy objectives, principles, and strategies.”1 As the awarded NSF SII Center,23 SpectrumX has leaned into these relationships and invited FCC and NTIA representatives to serve as Observers on its External Advisory Board (EAB) and developed engagement and collaborations with members of the FCC Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), NTIA Office of Spectrum Management (OSM), and NTIA Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS). We invite the FCC, NTIA, and other government agencies to lean into these opportunities for engagement and collaborations with SpectrumX as well.  One of the key elements of the SpectrumX vision is that scalable spectrum measurements and monitoring can contribute to more data-driven and automated approaches to spectrum management. We believe that this vision will be enabled by leveraging a combination of the following components: low-cost radio frequency (RF) and wireless network sensing technologies, open-source software, commodity cloud and data infrastructure, shared datasets, and machine learning tools. We also believe that harnessing these components into integrated measurement campaigns and networked sensing deployments represents a compelling opportunity to produce actionable data and insights for policymakers. However, members of our team have seen first-hand that there are many challenges associated with developing requirements (for sensors, data formats, databases, propagation models, monitoring/analysis/visualization systems, as well as fixed, mobile, and hybrid deployments), pursuing development (for hardware, software, and integration and testing), organizing measurement campaigns, and fielding networked sensing systems before meaningful data collections and analysis can begin. Rather than expecting to determine all these answers upfront, we are taking an iterative and agile approach to developing both technology components as well as a measurement, modeling, and analysis community.   1 FCC-NTIA-NSF Memorandum of Agreement (MoA), https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/blogimages/sii_moa_fcc_nsf_ntia.pdf 2 The SII Center is called the “National Center for Wireless Spectrum Research” in the MoA 3 NSF SII Center Announcement, https://new.nsf.gov/news/nsf-announces-launch-spectrumx-nsf-spectrum",1,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 3 of 14 Specifically, our approach has been to collect expertise within the Center, to focus on a reasonably small set of technologies and tools that we can evolve holistically, to grow a community of users and developers around them, and to engage and iterate with stakeholders in the spectrum ecosystem to move these capabilities forward toward broader consideration, and ultimately adoption.  The remainder of this comment highlights several of the most relevant aspects of SpectrumX’s research and workforce development efforts as well as our plans for specific integrations and pilots in the next year. Many other SpectrumX activities have not been included, for the sake of brevity.  We invite all stakeholders to engage in these projects to contribute to their success and impact. The SpectrumX Collaboration Advisory Board (CAB) provides a formal mechanism for industry, government agencies, and non-profits to help shape our activities. Upcoming opportunities to engage with our team include:  ● Center Meeting, Northwestern University, October 9-10, 2023 ● Center Meeting at NSF Spectrum Week, Washington, DC, May 13-17, 2024 ● Radio Shop Chats, held monthly ● Working Group Meetings, held bi-weekly  More information about the SpectrumX team, projects, events, and engagement opportunities is available at the Center website: https://spectrumx.org/.",2,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 4 of 14 Low-Cost, Distributed RF Sensing  One relevant thrust among the many SpectrumX research activities is to evolve low-cost RF sensors and sensing systems for the purposes of widespread spectrum monitoring. The anchor platform for this thrust within the Center is the RadioHound platform4, developed originally by students at the University of Notre Dame.  RadioHound provides a cloud infrastructure including a messaging and transport interface, centralized database, management dashboard, and user interface based upon a number of open-source software tools (MQTT, MongoDB, JSON, Python, NumPy/SciPy for example). A RadioHound sensor includes a custom RF sensor printed circuit board (PCB) leveraging commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and the BeagleBone Black5 embedded computing board.  A photograph of a RadioHound sensor and a screenshot of the web-based user interface are shown in the images below.

"Page 5 of 14   SpectrumX adopted V3.4 of the RadioHound sensor and has provided support for two revisions of the RF design as well as a number of software enhancements. The Center has been cultivating a community of “beta testers” at five (5) SpectrumX universities (Florida International University, MIT Haystack Observatory, University of California Berkeley, University of Colorado Boulder, and University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez) and two (2) government partners (NTIA and NIST). A total of fifteen (15) RadioHound sensors have been distributed to these users in the past two years. User feedback has been instrumental in refining the RadioHound sensor and support infrastructure to better meet the needs of a broad cross section of the community. Recognition of the importance of this community development grew out of support by Notre Dame of the FCC’s feasibility study to “test the feasibility of partnering with federal agencies, including USPS, that operate delivery fleet vehicles to collect data that can be used to verify and supplement broadband coverage information to explore integration of sensing technologies into federal delivery.”6 Experience with distributed broadband sensing is being utilized to advanced our distributed RF spectrum monitoring concept, hardware, software, and infrastructure.  The latest manufactured RadioHound sensor can be tuned from 100 MHz to 6 GHz, with an instantaneous bandwidth of 24 MHz. Its receiver sensitivity noise figure is roughly 2 dB, although this can be improved with application-specific amplification, filtering, and antennas. Downconverted in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) samples can be obtained and processed on the sensor, but the primary measurement that the sensor reports to the RadioHound cloud is a periodogram-based estimate of the power spectral density of the received signal. The capture range, resolution bandwidth, and temporal averaging of such a measurement can be controlled through the RadioHound user interface for an individual sensor or a group of sensors. Finally, the bill-of-materials (BOM) cost for a RadioHound sensor V3.6 is approximately $160 per board, with assembly costs estimated to be $100 per board for medium quantities.   6 FCC USPS Feasibility Study pursuant to the Broadband DATA Act, https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/report-congress-usps-broadband-data-collection-feasibility-05242021.pdf",4,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 6 of 14 An important part of the RadioHound system is the platform that is used to control the sensors and visualize their output, which is being expanded to accept a heterogeneous network of widely available commercial sensors, thus vastly expanding the scope and usability of the system.  Another important aspect of the system is its accessibility to crowdsourced development by students and professional staff and non-proprietary design, thus ensuring a lifespan beyond its original developers.  The SpectrumX spectrum measurements and monitoring effort is on track to produce the largest database of RF spectrum measurements obtained using standardized equipment and processes. Moreover, the measurements, being made by SpectrumX member institutions and other users, will span a wide variety of environments and time intervals ranging from hours to days to weeks to months, or more. In contrast, typical measurement campaigns last days, and only include a handful of different environments.  SpectrumX is firming up plans for the following activities in the coming year:  ● Distribute RadioHound V3.6 sensors with integrated antennas to beta testers, after finishing design, manufacturing, and testing ● Integrate commercial sensors into the RadioHound software, using a standard API such as the SoapySDR interface ● Compare features and exploring integration with the NTIA Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensor (SCOS) reference design7 ● Support deployments and measurement campaigns targeting validation of the system and assessment of midband spectrum utilization, starting specifically with 3-4 GHz ● Developing requirements and initial software for analysis and visualization of spectrum monitoring measurements to support data-driven policy ● Develop requirements and initial designs for expanding sensing capabilities to include tunability to 18 GHz and 100 MHz instantaneous bandwidth and integrated antennas

"Page 7 of 14 Smartphone-Based Sensing  Another relevant thrust among SpectrumX research activities is utilization of smartphone-based apps for wireless network investigations, including measurements of signal strength, network system information, and data throughput in real-world settings. The anchor tool for this thrust within the Center has been the SigCap app8, developed originally at the University of Chicago. The ability to leverage a user’s smartphone for measurements, with either a free or very low-cost app, is compelling for several reasons. Not only is there a substantial number of frequency bands that can be measured, but smartphones provide an unprecedented level of sensor density relative to the population if apps and crowdsourcing can be fully exploited.  SigCap utilizes the Android application programming interfaces (APIs) to extract wireless network information from either cellular and WiFi chipsets on a smartphone. Cellular measurements require one or more SIM cards to authorize the smartphone on a given operator’s network. The latest private cellular networks in the CBRS band can also be investigated, assuming appropriately provisioned SIM cards. As new technologies such as 5G and WiFi 6E are integrated into chipsets and the APIs, apps like SigCap can provide data on such networks as well.  Screenshots of the SigCap app are included in the images below, showing both Wi-Fi and cellular measurements. 
    8 University of Chicago SigCap, https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~muhiqbalcr/sigcap/",6,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 8 of 14    This past year, SpectrumX adopted smartphone-based sensing using SigCap and related tools for a project called Broadband Mapping Using Smartphones (Broadband MAP US), with the objectives of attracting students and faculty at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to the field, developing analyses and publications, and potentially contributing results to the FCC’s Broadband Mapping program. This project provided three smartphones and cellular service, one for each major carrier, to university teams consisting of a faculty advisor and three undergraduate or graduate students. Project coordination and user training was provided through the Center through a series of web video conference meetings and in-person meetings at Center events. To date, four (4) universities (Florida A&M University, Florida International University, Morgan State University and University of the Virgin Islands), eight (8) faculty, and thirteen (13) students have been engaged in the project, all of whom are new to SpectrumX.  Regarding the NOI’s question of whether usage can or should be studied through “representative sampling”, we caution that this notion may be difficult to establish. Measurements taken should be appropriate for individual urban, suburban and rural environments, and proxies should not be used to represent these environments. Using analyses in individual urban, suburban and rural environments to represent other environments could produce inaccuracies and misrepresentations of actual data in those specific environments. Investing in measuring actual data in distinct geographic areas will produce the most accurate representation of the environment. Furthermore, there is a risk to marginalized communities. Oftentimes, there is a tendency to define communities with less access based on communities with more access, misrepresenting the needs of marginalized communities. This practice could create assumptions of current resources and needs which could cause harm and further marginalize people in these communities. To avoid these issues, empowering members of local communities with tools and enabling local crowdsourcing of data could be a more equitable solution; inviting community members to the table to participate in the measurement process, including co-evolution of the tools and processes themselves, could result in more actual measurements and realistic characterization of coverage and access.  As one example of the potential power of this approach, Florida International University (FIU) Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) students and faculty ramped up over the course of just a few months to join in the Broadband MAP US project and present initial results at NSF Spectrum Week last Spring. The team collects and analyzes spectrum usage data in their local community of Miami, Florida through their own direct measurements obtained using cell phones served by the AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon networks and apps such as the FCC Speed Test and SigCap applications. According to Deidra Hodges, ECE Department Chair, “Obtaining a better understanding of non-federal spectrum usage requires a comprehensive approach that incorporates advanced technologies, data sharing, and collaboration like those being developed through the Broadband MAP US project. As importantly, this effort has energized our students to develop relevant skills and to impact their local community as well as national spectrum policy.”",7,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 9 of 14 Another smartphone-based sensing application is the use signals of opportunity to measure RF propagation loss, leading to improved propagation models. Traditionally, propagation models are developed or improved on the basis of data obtained through a targeted measurement campaign that makes use of expensive equipment to generate, and then measure, a reference signal. Using smartphones and known signals of opportunity, comparable – and much denser – data can be obtained.   SpectrumX is firming up plans for the following activities in the coming year:  ● Updating SigCap (and/or related apps) to make the user experience more intuitive and reliable, and to better support aggregation of collected data ● Expanding the network of universities, faculty, and students contributing data to the Broadband MAP US project, with continue priority for MSIs ● Identifying options for measuring satellite-based connectivity to smart phones, with the emergence of supplemental coverage from space (SCS)",8,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 10 of 14 High-Sensitivity Sensor Prototypes and Surveys in Millimeter Wave Bands  The SpectrumX team includes significant expertise in radio design for scientific sensing applications, both active and passive. Such systems are designed to operate at extreme sensitivities, and the related technologies could be brought to bear to help identify emissions “below the noise floor” of other sensing technologies. SpectrumX is making seed investments to explore this space and identify approaches that can be further developed and at least moderately scaled as part of its broader measurement and monitoring efforts.  As one example in this direction, SpectrumX has supported in part the development of a new radiometer technology called Multipath Cross Correlation Radiometry (MXCR).9 This technology enables automatic and reliable calibration of a radiometric spectrometer to traceable levels of sensitivity of below (1) degree Kelvin. SpectrumX is planning a mobile land-based survey of RF emissions across the country using this prototype radiometer. The first such survey will cover K-band (18-27 GHz), focusing on the 23.6-24.0 GHz EESS band used by NOAA for satellite meteorology. We are considering a road trip of approximately 20 major U.S. urban corridors and the rural areas in between. Additional spectrum surveys at nearby bands up to V-band (40-75 GHz) and W-band (75-110 GHz) are envisioned as this capability is developed.  We believe that such measurements can help reveal significant information about emissions that otherwise cannot easily be measured, and will ultimately drive requirements for spectrum sensing and monitoring systems in certain bands. In addition, these measurements will help predict radio frequency interference (RFI) effects on passive scientific systems, including weather satellites, especially as those systems increase their bandwidth of operation to enhance precision going forward. A central issue in this regard is improving propagation models to accurately predict how much ground-based emission reflects skyward into weather, environment (both passive and active), and telecommunications satellites.  SpectrumX is firming up plans for the following activities in the coming year:  ● Integrating the first MXCR radiometer with beam scanning onto a research vehicle with adequate data capture and storage capabilities ● Finalizing the timeline and route among cities, universities, and rural areas in the initial field survey ● Exploring opportunities to reduce costs and complexity of the instrumentation for adoption and conducting of surveys by others.    9 Multipath Cross-Correlation Radiometry (MXCR), Spectrum Week 2023 Poster, https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AC0cLrU93YDFUk9PVA",9,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Page 11 of 14 Data Formats, Sharing, and Machine Learning Analysis  As the ability to take measurements and collect data expands, the importance of common data formats, sharing, and analysis techniques, including machine learning (ML), will grow in importance. It is also critical to be able to manage/control a potentially distributed sensing environment, as well as allow code to securely run on such sensors without requiring human interaction. SpectrumX is addressing these issues as well.  The two main sensing platforms that SpectrumX has adopted, RadioHound and SigCap, utilize JSON10 data formats. The data specifications are made available to our member institutions and collaborating organizations, and will be made available openly as they stabilize and we add capacity to provide documentation and support. We recognize that data format specifications and documentation are required in order to make data sharing useful to a broader community of researchers and policymakers beyond the Center. It will be important to be able to filter the data based on frequency, location, time, type of measurement, and other relevant attributes. The ability to translate between data formats, and the ability to aggregate data sets based upon time and location stamps, will be critical as well.  Furthermore, as a Center we have committed to make all spectrum data collected and software developed using NSF support openly available through a centralized repository, managed and organized in a way that facilities use by external entities. In addition to our Center website(s), we intend to leverage and support other community platforms such as, for example, RF Data Factory11 and PAWR12 testbeds, for data dissemination.  One significant perceived obstacle to making progress in data sharing is the lack of technical/policy clarity regarding privacy concerns with raw data captured over the air. As our ability to extract useful insights from wireless signals increases, so does the hesitancy of some to share data, even data captured in public places using easily available hardware, out of fear of being accused of privacy violations. There is a clear need to develop and explain best practices in trading off spectrum information gathering and privacy protection.  With the growing application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools, we recognize the substantial opportunity to apply these tools to spectrum data analysis and spectrum management. Our focus is on developing new tools and making them accessible through a common framework, which we refer to as the SpectrumX Data / ML Platform. Among several examples, the SpectrumX Data / ML Platform will integrate spectrum analysis algorithms for transmitter discovery, tracking, and fingerprinting that use inherently partial and imperfect data that inherently results from the sweep-based and / or intermittent scans collected by low-cost sensors in the field.13   10 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), https://www.json.org/json-en.html 11 RF Data Factory, https://www.rfdatafactory.com/home-page 12 Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR), https://advancedwireless.org/ 13 UbiNet Lab Website: http://www.cs.albany.edu/~mariya/lab/publications.html",10,SpectrumX FCC Non-Federal Spectrum NOI Response v5.pdf,SpectrumX,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

SpectrumX’s vision is to conduct projects to help modernize radio spectrum management and accelerate spectrum-dependent technologies and applications that benefit society. These efforts were initiated in September 2021 with a 5-year, $25M grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through its Spectrum Innovation Initiative (SII) Center program.  SpectrumX brings together broad and synergistic research capabilities from a team of 41 founding researchers and staff from 27 top universities, including a number of minority serving institutions (MSIs). This team comprises a diverse and interdisciplinary group of scientists, engineers, and educators with backgrounds in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Aerospace, Astronomy, Geoscience, Economics, Policy, and Workforce Development. In addition, SpectrumX benefits from an External Advisory Board (EAB) of highly experienced and influential people who are interested in serving in both advisory and ambassador roles to advance the Center’s mission.  SpectrumX is positioned to serve as a trusted national resource on spectrum issues with the ability to quickly tap into a wide array of expertise across disparate use cases and user communities of radio spectrum. Through its coordination and engagement activities, SpectrumX is able to anticipate and track spectrum issues, pursue research on technology and policy breakthroughs, and share results and insights with policymakers. Although SpectrumX can summarize tradeoffs and provide recommendations for effective policy options, it does not, and in fact cannot, advocate for specific policy decisions.

"lifeline services5 during disasters and emergencies  to providing broadband internet  across the U.S., 
including  to rural and underserved communities , to providing images of Earth that advance science and 
security , and countless other invaluable services. The U.S. satellite industry ’s role in global society will 
only continue to increase . As Chairwoman Rosenworcel stated, “We are seeing new commercial  models , 
new players, and new technologies coming together to pioneer a wide range of new satellite services and 
space -based activities.”6  
As discussed below, SIA recommends  that any definition of “spectrum usage”  developed by the 
Commission: ( i) acknowledge that there is no one -size-fits-all definition, and should thus be service -
specific,  (ii) delink measuring spectrum use, generally, from measuring “efficient” use, which is 
undefined in the NOI and (iii) account for the qualitative and intangible benefits of service s such as 
critical safety of life services , services critical to the future of space exploration , and services to rural and 
underserved communities from space that might fare poorly on quantit ative assessments . 
Moreover, it should be acknowledged that spectrum use measurements, in and of themselves, 
only provide a snapshot into use at a given time and thus what the data tell us about today’s use may not 
wholly reflect the requirements of tomorr ow. Indeed, as outlined in the whitepaper provided in Appendix 
I, without prioritizing more spectrum for the U.S. commercial space industry, the U.S. risks losing the 
space race.  
II. DEFINING SPECTRUM USAGE  
A. There is no one -size-fits-all definition —or methodol ogy—which appropriately characterizes 
spectrum use across the myriad varied spectrum -dependent technologies and services.  
 
As a general principle, SIA concurs with similar past efforts7 which have concluded  that there is 
no one -size-fits-all definition that appropriately characterizes spectrum use across the myriad varie d

the community that, when stabilized, enable all other aspects of society.”  See DHS , Community Lifelines (accessed

Spectrum Environment : Data and Monitoring to Improve Spectrum Utilization  at 13 ( Aug. 2014); accord National

"technologies and services , and thus recommends that the Commission develop a methodology for 
measuring use on a service -by-service basis.  Indeed, within  the broad category of  satellite systems alone, 
the significant diversity of service types makes it difficult —and perhaps not  meaningful —to establish a 
single highly prescriptive definition of spectrum use for satell ite services.  Similarly , a number of 
definitions identified  in the NOI define  use as the exceedance of a predetermined signal threshold.8 If 
uniformly applied across the wide variety of spectrum -dependent applications , such definitions could 
prove problem atic; the frequency hopping capability of certain satellites, for instance, means that a 
satellite’s total allocated bandwidth is in use, such that the satellite may hop from frequency to frequency 
therein, even if a signal exceeding a specific threshold is not registered on a specific subset of an allocated 
band at the time of measurement ; or if a network is still in its early stage and is continuing to acquire 
customers .  
The NOI also inquires as to how the design techniques noted in its Spectrum Policy Statement9 
should affect spectrum use evaluation.10 SIA cautions against leveraging these techniques for the 
Commission’s evaluation of spectrum usage: as these design techniques a re intended to “help satisfy 
performance and reliability expectations ,” their inclusion in a definition of spectrum usage could result in 
the “spectrum usage” definition becoming de facto performance and reliability requirements —even 
though the Spectrum Po licy Statement  is non-binding.11 In other words,  services may run the risk of being 
deemed as not using their allocated spectrum should they not incorporate the techniques in the Spectrum 
Policy Statement . 
B. De-linking spectrum use from spectrum efficiency . 
 
 The Commission states, “[l]everaging today’s tools to understand tomorrow’s commercial 
spectrum usage needs can help identify new opportunities to facilitate more efficient spectrum use …”,12

"and “ [o]ur holistic framework seeks to keep pace with emerging technologies to maximize the efficient 
use of spectrum”13—inexorably linking  spectrum “use” with spectrum “efficiency .” “Efficiency” is not 
the sole determinant of the public benefit , value,  or usefulness of a particular spectrum use case and SIA 
recommends that the Commission de -link spectrum use from spectrum efficiency.  Indeed, the FCC’s 
Technical Advisory Committee (“TAC”) similarly previously concluded, “ [j]ust as counting the number 
of cars on a highway is not the only measure of a road’s val ue, efficiency is not the only consideration 
when it comes to re -evaluating spectrum.”14  
SIA simi larly does not support establishing a common standard for defining whether a system is 
spectrally efficient , e.g., weather and communications satellite s shoul d not be measured (and compared) 
simply on a singular measure of spectral efficiency  or use , as they not only use spectrum differently , they 
provide different public benefits . By the same token, measuring (and comparing) the wide array of 
terrestrial spect rum-based applications —mobile, fixed, unlicensed, radars, public safety, broadcasting, 
NFC, UWB, etc. —using a single metric of spectral efficiency or use would not make sense.  
C. Accounting for qualitative  and intangible value of services.  
Just as t he public  benefit, value , and usefulness of a spectrum -dependent capability  cannot be 
reduced to any single measure of spectrum efficiency or use , it also should not be limited  to exclusively 
quantitative measures . Qualitative evaluations will be unavoidable. For instance, critical safety of li fe 
services may be perceived as quantitively “less used” than other services, though they must remain highly 
available for when other communications infrastructure becomes inoperable. Further, the public good 
derived from  provisioning services to rural and underserved communities from spac e cannot easily be 
distilled down to a quantifiable technical metric  to determine use. In addition, SIA notes that as systems 
and networks come online, user adoption is often not instanta neous —it takes time.  It is critical that this 
reality, and others, be reflected in any spectrum use analysis.  SIA thus believes that d eveloping a means 
through which qualitative spectrum use considerations are appropriately  represented and weighted , in

"addition and relative  to technical quantitative methods will provide the Commission with the most 
accurate picture of spectrum use, i.e., it will better help the Commission to understand not only whether 
spectrum is being used, but how and why . 
III. CONCLUSION  
SIA commends the Commission for seeking to advance its understanding of non -Federal 
spectrum use , which is increasingly important given the proliferation of new spectrum -dependent 
services. SIA looks forward to working closely with the Commission  on this d ocket  to ensure that the 
U.S. remains the global leader in satellite technolog ies and services.

"National Policy Must Prioritize More Spectrum for the U.S. Commercial  
Space Industry or the United States Will Lose the Space Race   
The space industry ’s massive surge in technology is being led by U.S. innovation.    Satellite and space services are 
touching the lives of every citizen directly and indirectly. Further, these services are becoming increasingly 
integrated in 5G and will be more so in 6G. In addition, the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of 
Defense and NASA, is relying increasingly on commercial satellites and space services.   As recognized in the N ational 
Space Policy, this means making more megahertz of spectrum available for commercial satellite and space services 
is critical.   For the U.S. government to lead the world in the new space race and compete with global adversaries, it 
must have a coher ent multi -agency policy that ensures that the spectrum needs of the commercial satellite and 
space community are met.   To meet the significant increasing demands of users, whether government, consumer 
or enterprise, not only must the U.S. provide continued  access to existing allocations, but additional spectrum is 
required in the low, mid and high bands.    
 
The need for access to additional spectrum is further 
demo nstrated by the significant growth of the  
U.S. commercial satellite and space industry.   The U.S. 
commercial satellite and space industry have made and are  
continuing make hundreds of billions of dollars in investment.   
For example, the number of operational satellites has grown 
from approximately 1000 in 2013 to 7316 as of the end of 2022 
(right). Another 2100+ satellites have alr eady been launched 
in 20232 and this pace of growth is expected to continue with 
approximately 10,000 satellites orbiting by the end of the year 
and applications for tens of thousands of satellites already 
having been approved.    
It is not just the number of satellites that is growing. The capacity of those satellites deployed also has increased 
significantly.   As of mid -2022, operators have announced plans to deploy an additional 200 Tbps of capacity through 
2026. In addition, in the past 10 years we have seen a 6x increase in the throughput per kilogram launched, leading 
to increased capability across the many services provided by satellites. One example of the impact this has had is 
there has been an 83% increase in satellite broadband subscribers since 2 018. Similarly, commercial Earth 
Observation satellites collect and download more than 100 terabytes of satellite imagery data per day.1

"The time is Now for U.S Policy Makers to Prioritize the Growing  
Spectru m Needs of the Space Industry   
U.S. spectrum policy makers have in recent years elevated the spectrum needs of commercial wireless over those of 
the satellite and space industry. Because of this approach, there has been a lack of recognition in making spe ctrum 
decisions about spectrum policy concerning the incredible growth and importance to the U.S. economy of the U.S. 
space industry.    The time is now for U.S policy makers to prioritize the growing spectrum needs of the space 
industry to ensure we can m eet the needs for the United States, as well ensure U.S. space leadership globally.   
If the United States is to lead in space globally, as well as address digital divide issues, it is critical that the United 
States government lead domestically and internationally in ensuring that there is adequate spectrum to support the 
rapid growth of t he new space industry and the applications their customers rely upon. The objective must be to 
make new spectrum available no later than 2027 to ensure the United States' competitive edge in the rapidly 
evolving space industry including for 5G and 6G.   Th is requires at least 15 GHz of spectrum of low, mid and high 
band spectrum to accommodate the growing number of applications in the 390 MHz to the 60 GHz band nationally 
and globally.   
U.S. Innovation of New and Novel Services is Leading to Exponential In crease in 
Demand for Satellite and Space Radiocommunications Services   
An important part of this innovation includes the development of non -terrestrial network standards (NTN) in 3GPP 
and the increasing integration of terrestrial and satellite communicatio ns services.  The inclusion of non terrestrial 
technologies in 5G and soon to be 6G standards, including 3GPP, means that satellite communications is becoming 
and will continue to become more pervasive including for direct to device, cellular backhaul, IoT and other 
widespread uses.    
The integration of sensing and communication is a key enabler for a wide range of use cases, such as cellular 
backhaul and satellite direct connectivity to devices.  Moreover, sensing the physical surroundings together with AI  
will further enhance situational awareness.  Sensing supports various innovative applications such as high precision 
positioning and localization of devices and objects, high resolution and real -time 3D -mapping for automated and 
safe driving/transport, di gital twins, and industrial automation.   
  
Because of this increasing innovation, the satellite and space industry are supporting:   
 
• Inclusivity and Ubiquitous Connectivity: Commercial satellite broadband and narrowband services are able 
to address the digital divide so that all users have access to critical communications services. Today, there are 
over 2 million3 satellite broadband subscribers across the United States, sate llite is providing critical backhaul 
services for 5G cellular networks, and there are deployed satellite -enabled direct to device services, such as 
the Apple I -Phone, the Bullitt device and others.   With the dramatic increases we are seeing (for instance,  an 
83% increase in satellite broadband subscribers and remote sensing data revenues increasing by 
approximately 50% over the past five years), additional spectrum for these uses must be available now.     
• Communications on the Move: The increasing relianc e of users on communications services on the move 
including in land, air and water require significant additional capacity to meet demand.   These services 
include everything from supporting smart roads, autonomous transportation, the needs of crew, and 
safetyof -life to entertainment.    
• Enhanced security, privacy and resilience:  By monitoring, encrypting, and managing data, as well as 
providing secure storage, satellite technology helps to ensure citizens' data is safe and secure. Satellite data,",7,SIA Non-Federal NOI Response Final.pdf,THE SATELLITE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"providing secure storage, satellite technology helps to ensure citizens' data is safe and secure. Satellite data, 
combined with geospatial datasets and machine learning will  enhance  security,  resilie ncy and efficiency in 
smart grid implementation and management. Satellites will also provide increasing situational and security 
data for pipelines, offshore rigs and storage facilities. As satellites provide a comprehensive view of the world 
from above,  satellites will increasingly be used to detect and prevent threats to a nation's security including  
monitoring borders, detecting suspicious activity, and providing intelligence on potential threats.

• Ubiquitous computing: Satellites are critical to support the ubiquitous use of data computing resources. 
Emerging trends in this regard include expansion of data processing in the network infrastructure to the 
network cloud and devices  that are closer to the origin of the data and support for proliferation of ubiquitous 
intelligence globally. One facet of ubiquitous computing is that equipping smart objects with appropriate 
transmitters and receivers enables precise localization. Satell ite supported localization technology is an 
absolute necessity.4  
• Smart industrial applications: Through the leveraging of real -time intelligence and its ability to facilitate 
interactions between machines and citizens, satellite technology can scale to me et the performance of smart 
industrial applications.  As these needs continue to grow, satellite capacity will have to scale up to meet these 
demands.   
• Lunar: Human exploration missions to the Moon are set to occur as early as 2025.   Lunar equipment incl udes 
spacesuits, handhelds, habitation, other lunar assets and other communication stations, landers, rovers, and 
extravehicular activity.    All lunar equipment will require connectivity on the moon as well as ultimately, back 
to earth.   It is critical t hat the U.S. government make available spectrum to support these expected needs.    
• Digital health and well -being:  Through the leveraging of AI, edge computing, ubiquitous connectivity, 
multi -sensory communication, positioning and sensing related capabili ties, satellite technology is facilitating 
digital health services including interactive and remote monitoring, telediagnosis, remote tele -medical 
assistance (including tele -connected ambulances), tele -rehabilitation, digital clinical trials and telemedici ne.   
As the medical community and patients become increasingly reliant on digital health, including in rural and 
remote areas, having sufficient satellite capacity will be key to its success.   
• Environmental Applications: Satellite services enable critical  environmental monitoring that terrestrial 
networks cannot do. This includes climate change surveillance, energy management, animal tracking, and 
support for polar expeditions. Leveraging satellite technology facilitates a broader understanding of our 
planet, supports sustainable practices, and aids in the conservation of biodiversity.    As these applications 
increase in importance to the health of our planet, there needs to be sufficient spectrum to support this 
demand.   
• Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Communications: Satellite services provide reliable, uninterrupted 
communication during crisis situations, enabling efficient emergency responses, predictive capabilities, and 
support during recovery phases. Earth observ ation satellites likewise can enable monitoring and early warning 
of natural disasters such as wildfires and also aid in recovery efforts.  To ensure that the United States has the 
available capacity to meet the anticipated growth in need for these communi cations, additional spectrum 
must be made available.    
• Sustainability:   Satellite technology is addressing the need for increased environmental, agricultural, social, 
and economic sustainability, and also supports the goals of the Paris Agreement of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. Leveraging circular economy principles helps retain and recover 
value from resources and extend lifetime through such important considerations as reusing, repairing, 
repurposing or recycling.  To meet the growing need of sustainability applications, there must be adequate 
spectrum for satellite services to meet this demand.   
• Space -to-Space Communications: Intersatellite links (ISLs) provide a real -time connectivity solution by",8,SIA Non-Federal NOI Response Final.pdf,THE SATELLITE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"spectrum for satellite services to meet this demand.   
• Space -to-Space Communications: Intersatellite links (ISLs) provide a real -time connectivity solution by  
allowing satellites to co mmunicate with each other or with third -party satellites to relay data when outside 
the range of an Earth station.  Recognizing the value of next -generation ISLs for a variety of satellite missions 
that require two -way, higher capacity capabilities, it is critical that additional spectrum is allocated for this 
use.",8,SIA Non-Federal NOI Response Final.pdf,THE SATELLITE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Additional Capacity is Required for the United States to Win the Space Race   
The importance of the U.S. satellite and space industry cannot be overstated. Satellite and space 
radiocommunications services are crucial for a myriad of applications that affect economics, health, education and 
U.S. national security, and more.  By addre ssing these pressing needs through leveraging space, we can continue 
to drive our nation's progress, innovate, and lead in the space sector. It's time for our national policy to recognize 
this urgency and act now to secure our future in the space race.   F ailure to do so now and into the future will allow 
our adversaries to take the lead and jeopardize the United States ’ ability to win the space race.    
To meet the myriad use cases addressed here, and the increasing use cases as we head to a 6G world, it is critical 
that space -based communications have access to the spectrum requirements it needs (both existing and new 
allocations).  Because of the varied  needs, the satellite and space industry must have made available (in addition to 
the existing allocations) by 2027 at least 15 GHz more of spectrum available globally within a wide variety of 
frequency bands from 390 MHz to 60 GHz.

Introduction
A
key
problem
hindering
the
realization
of
crowd-sourced
spectrum
monitoring
is
how
to
establish
trust
in
the
quality
of
data
offered
by
each
spectrum
monitoring
node.
There
are
numerous
problems
that
affect
the
quality
of
data
such
as
the
efficiency
of
the
antenna
and
the
sensitivity
of
the
SDR
in
the
desired
spectrum
bands,
potential
obstruction
of
the
antenna
in
relation
to
the
signal
source,
and
installation
issues
such
as
damaged
antenna
cables.
Note
that
these
nodes
are
set
up
by
uncoordinated
self-selected
people
around
the
world,
and
no
assumptions
can
be
made
about
the
quality
of
the
setup.
Furthermore,
if
node
operators
are
paid
for
their
services,
there
is
a
potential
incentive
to
provide
fabricated
or
incorrect
data
in
order
to
receive
reimbursement.

How
to
bring
reliability
to
low-cost
and
crowd-sourced
RF
sensors
Utilizing
""signals
of
opportunity""
is
an
emerging
approach
to
automatically
evaluating
RF
sensors
without
any
human
supervision,
ensuring
their
reliability.
In
a
recent
study
2
,
we
have
addressed
two
technical
challenges
using
signals
of
opportunity:
1)
How
can
we
automatically
determine
the
presence
of
obstructions
around
an
RF
sensor?
2)
How
can
we
automatically
assess
the
reception

"capability
of
an
RF
sensor
across
frequency
bands?
We
evaluate
RF
sensors
in
terms
of
their
reception
capability
including
the
environments
in
which
the
sensor
is
installed
in,
the
antenna,
RF
cables
and
the
SDR
itself.
We
are
going
to
present
this
work
at
ACM
HotNets
2023
workshop
and
we
would
like
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
commission.
The
concept
of
signals
of
opportunity
involves
the
exploitation
of
existing
radio
signals,
such
as
Wi-Fi,
cellular,
Aircraft
(ADSB),
or
satellite
transmissions,
for
the
purpose
of
assessing
the
capabilities
and
accuracy
of
RF
sensors.
At
its
core,
the
idea
is
that
these
signals
are
well
understood
and
can
be
detected/tracked
by
many
diverse
devices
including
low-cost
SDRs,
enabling
us
to
automatically
(without
human
intervention)
characterize
any
spectrum
sensor
that
is
picking
them
up.
Such
characterization
can
then
be
used
to
automatically
generate
meta-data
associated
with
the
sensor
that
allows
its
measurements
to
be
meaningfully
interpreted
and
combined
with
those
from
other
sensors.
This
approach
offers
several
advantages:
●
Real-world
Testing
Environment:
Signals
of
opportunity
provide
a
real-world
testing
environment
for
RF
sensors,
as
they
represent
some
of
the
actual
radio
signals
present
in
the
environment
where
these
sensors
will
be
deployed.
This
ensures
that
the
evaluation
process
closely
mirrors
the
conditions
that
the
sensors
will
encounter
during
operational
use.
●
Continuous
Monitoring:
Unlike
controlled
laboratory
testing,
signals
of
opportunity
allow
for
continuous
monitoring
and
evaluation.
RF
sensors
can
be
subjected
to
a
diverse
range
of
signals,
enabling
ongoing
assessment
of
their
performance
over
time,
which
is
crucial
for
detecting
issues
that
may
arise
during
extended
use.
This
also
facilitates
fast
and
efficient
iterative
development
of
systems
that
depend
on
SDRs.
●
Diverse
Signal
Types:
Signals
of
opportunity
encompass
a
wide
variety
of
signal
types
and
frequencies,
allowing
for
comprehensive
testing.
Sensors
can
be
evaluated
against
different
modulation
schemes,
frequencies,
and
power
levels,
ensuring
their
adaptability
to
various
communication
standards
and
bands.
●
Cost-Effective:
Leveraging
existing
signals
reduces
the
need
for
specialized
test
equipment
or
the
generation
of
synthetic
signals,
which
can
be
expensive
and
resource-intensive.
This
cost-effectiveness
makes
it
accessible
to
a
broader
range
of
researchers
and
organizations.",2,Comments_Spectrum_NOI.pdf,Professor Anant Sahai and Dr. Ali Abedi,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"●
Real-world
Interference:
Signals
of
opportunity
introduce
realistic
interference
scenarios
that
RF
sensors
may
encounter
in
the
field.
This
helps
in
assessing
how
well
these
sensors
can
filter
out
noise
and
unwanted
signals,
providing
insights
into
their
robustness.
●
Adaptive
Learning:
By
continuously
monitoring
and
analyzing
signals
of
opportunity,
RF
sensors
can
employ
machine
learning
algorithms
to
adapt
and
improve
their
performance
over
time.
They
can
learn
to
recognize
and
mitigate
sources
of
interference
and
adjust
their
parameters
for
optimal
operation.
●
Security
and
Spectrum
Management:
The
use
of
signals
of
opportunity
can
aid
in
detecting
unauthorized
or
interfering
transmissions,
which
is
vital
for
spectrum
management
and
security.
Automatic
evaluation
of
sensors
can
help
government
agencies
and
network
operators
identify
potential
threats
and
vulnerabilities.
●
Data
Fusion:
Combining
data
from
multiple
RF
sensors
that
are
evaluating
signals
of
opportunity
can
provide
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
the
RF
environment.
Data
fusion
techniques
can
be
applied
to
enhance
the
accuracy
and
reliability
of
the
assessments.

Examples
of
“signals
of
opportunity”
for
automatic
calibration
of
RF
sensors
We
have
already
studied
two
signals
of
opportunity
namely,
ADS-B
signals
from
nearby
airplanes
and
APT
signals
from
NOAA
polar
orbiting
satellites.
Here
we
describe
these
two
examples
and
then
we
explain
how
other
signals
can
be
incorporated
into
the
platform
we
are
building
for
automatic
evaluation
of
RF
sensors
without
any
human
supervision.
Signals
from
nearby
airplanes
In
order
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
an
RF
sensor
in
receiving
wireless
signals
from
different
directions,
we
measure
how
well
it
can
receive
ADS-B
signals
transmitted
from
nearby
airplanes.
ADS-B
(Automatic
Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast)
is
a
wireless
network
that
allows
aircraft
to
broadcast
their
position,
altitude,
and
velocity
information
to
other
aircraft
and
ground
stations.
This
information
is
transmitted
over
the
1090
MHz
band.
Airplanes
broadcast
their
position
and
velocity",3,Comments_Spectrum_NOI.pdf,Professor Anant Sahai and Dr. Ali Abedi,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"at
least
two
times
per
second
when
they
are
airborne.
These
messages
are
not
encrypted.
Therefore,
an
RF
sensor
can
receive
and
decode
them
when
within
the
range.
We
exploit
this
open
architecture
and
receive
ADS-B
messages
on
the
sensor
we
want
to
evaluate.
These
messages
reveal
which
directions
have
an
unobstructed
view
and
which
directions
are
occluded.
We
used
the
dump1090
program
3
to
decode
the
signal
we
receive
on
the
SDR.
Receiving
ADS-B
messages
from
a
distant
airplane
is
a
strong
indicator
that
the
field
of
view
is
open
in
that
direction.
However,
not
receiving
any
messages
from
a
direction
does
not
necessarily
indicate
blockage.
It
could
be
the
case
that
there
were
no
aircraft
in
that
direction
at
the
time
of
measurement.
Therefore,
we
combine
the
data
we
receive
on
a
sensor
with
the
data
obtained
from
flight
tracking
platforms
such
as
FlightRadar24
4
to
see
if
there
is
any
airplane
in
the
direction
from
which
we
received
no
messages.
Figure
1,
shows
an
example
of
ADS-B
reception
on
an
RF
sensor.
Each
point
on
these
plots
represents
an
airplane
within
300
km
of
the
sensor.
Blue
points
represent
airplanes
that
the
sensor
successfully
received
at
least
one
ADS-B
message
from
during
the
30
second
measurement
period.
Gray
points
are
airplanes
that
no
message
was
received
from.
The
shaded
area
represents
the
unobstructed
field
of
view
of
the
sensor.
The
figure
shows
that
the
sensor
could
receive
signals
from
airplanes
as
far
as
270
km
in
the
direction
of
unobstructed
field
of
view
and
limited
or
no
reception
from
other
directions.
In
Section
4,
we
describe
how
this
information
is
used
to
estimate
the
field
of
view
of
a
sensor

Signals
from
NOAA
polar
orbiting
satellites
We
have
also
utilized
signals
transmitted
by
the
NOAA
polar
orbiting
weather
satellites.
These
satellites
monitor
and
predict
worldwide
weather
patterns
and
conditions.
NOAA
polar
orbiting
satellites
orbit
the
Earth
at
a
relatively
low
altitude
of
850
km
and
transmit
high-power
signals
(i.e.,
5
Watts)
within
the
137
MHz
band,
making
their
signal
an
excellent
signal
of
opportunity.
We
have
demonstrated
that
a
low-cost
SDR
can
receive
signals
from
NOAA
satellites,
even
when
using
a
wide-band
antenna
not
specifically
tuned
for
137
MHz.
We
capture
analog
APT
(automatic
picture
transmission)
signals
from
NOAA
satellites.
Determining
if
an
SDR
receives
an
analog
signal
from
a
satellite
is
not
trivial.
To
solve
this
issue,
we
compare
the
doppler
shift
of
the
signal
believed
to
be
from
a
particular
satellite
with
the
theoretical
doppler
shift
(that
acts
as
the
ground
truth).
If
the
doppler
shift
of
the
measured
signal
tracks
the
theoretical
values
our
methodology
determines
that
the
signal
is
in
fact
from
the
satellite.
Figure
2
illustrates
this
process.
Except
for
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
pass
when
the
signal
is
too
weak
(probably
due
to
obstruction),
the
empirically
measured
signal
follows
the
Doppler
shift
as
expected,
confirming
that
the
signal
is
coming
from
the
intended
satellite.",5,Comments_Spectrum_NOI.pdf,Professor Anant Sahai and Dr. Ali Abedi,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Analyzing
signals
of
opportunity
to
estimate
the
field
of
view
of
an
RF
sensor
The
data
obtained
from
airplanes
and
satellites
are
fed
into
a
non-parametric
classifier
to
estimate
the
probability
of
detection
(PD)
for
an
aircraft
or
satellite
at
any
given
location.
An
off-the-shelf
non-parametric
learning
approach,
the
K-Nearest
Neighbors
(KNN)
algorithm,
is
used
to
calculate
the
probability
of
detection.
The
number
of
neighbors,
K,
is
determined
by
K-fold
cross-validation
with
a
classification
accuracy
metric.
Finally,
we
make
the
assumption
that,
barring
receiver
saturation,
reception
should
only
improve
as
an
emitter
gets
closer
to
the
sensor.
Thus,
a
'radial-max'
operation
is
performed
on
the
KNN
output,
in
which
samples
along
each
radial
direction
are
set
to
the
maximum
value
seen
so
far,
from
far
to
near.
The
final
output
for
the
merged
airplane
and
satellite
data
is
shown
in
Figure

In

an

Emerging

We

the
contributions
presented

the
foundational
building
blocks
of
a
collaborative
evaluation

verification
system
that
is
now
clearly
in

comprehensively
assess

performance

sensor

The

encompasses
the
creation

a

that
empowers
researchers
to

Other
comments
While
the
majority
of
this
comment
has
been
focussed
on
how
signals-of-opportunity
represent
a
way
to
enable
reliable
and
meaningful
crowdsourcing
of
spectrum-relevant
data,
in
this
section
we
respond
to
other
issues
raised
in
the
NOI.
1.
The
NOI
asks
whether
“
sensors
should
have
very
high
sensitivity
to
distinguish
between
intended
signals
and
out-of-band
noise…
and
power
levels
should
be
measured
within
a
sufficiently
small
uncertainty.
Do
these
technical
challenges
remain
today?
”
along
with
“
Must
we
know
the
location
of
transmitters
and
receivers
to
properly
measure
spectrum
usage?
”
These
questions
are
interlinked
and
we
have
actually
looked
at
them
in
earlier
work
5
.
Properly
measuring
“spectrum
usage”
only
makes
rigorous
sense
within
the
context
of
a
goal.
a.
If
the
goal
is
to
understand
where
a
certain
level
of
use
by
a
candidate
new
transmitter
would
be
non-interfering,
then
the
(approximate)
location
of
the
candidate
new
transmitter
is
indeed
very
important,
as
is
potentially
information
about
its
siting
(e.g.
indoors
vs
outdoors
vs
next
to
a
window
facing
East,
etc…).
However,
while
this
information
about
the
candidate
new
transmitter
is
relevant
for
a
decision
to
be
made,
it
is
distinct
from
information
that
is
collected
to
set
the
stage
for
the
policy
question
as
to
whether
such
decisions
should
be
made
for
this
band
in
this
location.
b.
Similarly,
the
location
and
siting
of
a
potentially
interfered-with
existing
receiver
is
also
potentially
helpful
for
decision
making.
However,
even
without
such
information,
it
is
possible
to
make
these
decisions
at
the
cost
of
being
a
bit
more
conservative
and
having
to
decide
a-priori
whether
such
potential
victim
receivers
are
deemed
protected
or
not.
c.
The
location
of
existing
transmitters
is
very
useful
information
because,
when
combined
with
propagation
models,
it
allows
us
to
potentially
better
interpolate/extrapolate
from
a
spectrum
measurement
taken
in
one
location
to
estimate
the
situation
in
another
location.
Even
if
transmitters
are
not
registered,

The

us

the

in
the

although
developing
the
details
of
how
to
do
this
in
an

way
is
something
that

to
be
worked
out.
The
single
best
place
to
understand
the
impact
of
signals
on
receivers
is
at
the
receivers
themselves.
What
is
required
is
the
right
meta-data
6
For
example,
it
is
possible
to
approximately
localize

received

power
measurements 
together
with
propagation
models,
but
this
requires
us
to
be
able
to
compare
such
measurements
from 
different
sites.
For
such
comparisons
to
be
meaningful,
we
need
to
achieve
a
level
of
calibration
for
the 
spectrum
sensors.
Signals
of
opportunity
that
are
visible
to
both
of
them
(e.g.
a
satellite)
can
help
achieve 
this.
It
is
also
possible
to
localize

much
better
actually)
by
leveraging
time-delay
measurements 
and
using
explicit/implicit
trilateration-based
techniques.
This
requires
spectrum

to
be
able
to 
measure
(relative)

which
requires
understanding/calibrating
both
local
clocks
as
well
as
sometimes 
being
able
to
cross-correlate
actually

this

"Before the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20554  In the Matter of )  ) Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal ) WT Docket No. 23-232 Spectrum Usage )  )   COMMENTS OF CTIA CTIA1 respectfully submits these comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) released by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) seeking comment on how to better obtain more sophisticated knowledge of non-federal spectrum usage.2   I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. As Chairwoman Rosenworcel noted, a key goal of this proceeding is to better understand spectrum usage to “facilitate more efficient use of this scarce resource.”3  To most effectively achieve that goal, CTIA suggests that the Commission begin with the “low-hanging fruit” by focusing on bands where less robust use of spectrum is likely, or has been shown, to exist, as opposed to examining bands where efficiency is “built in.”  For example, the market incentives facing the commercial wireless industry, along with the Commission’s flexible use spectrum policies, have inexorably led to innovation, investment, and more intensive and efficient use of  1 CTIA – The Wireless Association® (“CTIA”) (www.ctia.org) represents the U.S. wireless communications industry and the companies throughout the mobile ecosystem that enable Americans to lead a 21st century connected life. The association’s members include wireless carriers, device manufacturers, suppliers as well as apps and content companies.  CTIA vigorously advocates at all levels of government for policies that foster continued wireless innovation and investment.  The association also coordinates the industry’s voluntary best practices, hosts educational events that promote the wireless industry and co-produces the industry’s leading wireless tradeshow.  CTIA was founded in 1984 and is based in Washington, D.C. 2 Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, WT Docket No. 23-232, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 23-63 (rel. Aug. 4, 2023) (“Spectrum Usage NOI”). 3 Id., Statement of Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, at 17.",2,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"2  spectrum.  Efficient use of spectrum is the logical outgrowth of spectrum bands that are: (1) licensed for exclusive use, (2) subject to a vibrant secondary market including leasing, and (3) providing service in a competitive market.   Therefore, CTIA encourages the Commission to tailor spectrum usage information collection on a band-by-band basis, with a focus on spectrum bands that do not have these competitive incentives such as shared/unlicensed spectrum bands and bands where licensing is done outside of competitive bidding.  Specifically, the SAS databases providing insight into the Citizens Band Radio Service (“CBRS”) and the International Communications Filing System (“ICFS”) database are existing spectrum usage resources that can be explored prior to suggesting new data collections for Commission licensees.  As part of its spectrum usage inquiry, the Commission should also work collaboratively with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) to collect federal spectrum usage information.  Once the Commission has reviewed detailed usage information it will be better positioned to create accurate spectrum usage metrics that are multi-faceted and take into consideration components such as number of consumers served, geographic usage, frequency usage, and time usage.  Finally, any new spectrum usage data collection, if determined to be necessary in the future, should be narrowly tailored to avoid privacy and competitive sensitivities.  II. THE COMMISSION SHOULD FOCUS ON SPECTRUM BANDS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COMPETITIVE MARKET PRESSURES FOR ITS SPECTRUM USAGE INQUIRY. The NOI suggests that the radiofrequency environment is growing more congested and that there is a greater need to obtain spectrum usage data to improve spectrum management.4   4 See Spectrum Usage NOI at 1.",3,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3  The commercial wireless industry, licensed on an exclusive, flexible use basis via a competitive auction process and subject to a competitive secondary transaction market, has inarguably driven dramatic increases in usage and spectrum efficiency over the past several decades.  This is for good reason. Thanks to this ownership structure, mobile spectrum license holders can react to competitive pressures by either building networks to continue expanding their commercial services or leasing or selling those licenses in the secondary market to stakeholders with higher valuation for spectral resources. The result is highly efficient refarming of spectrum.  By contrast, other licensing or spectrum access models lack these market incentives. Under licensing models where spectrum is shared (such as satellite, CBRS, etc.), granted by rule or unlicensed, stakeholders do not have the same mechanisms or incentives to ensure that unused or underutilized spectrum is refarmed and thus transferred to use cases with higher valuation and greater spectral efficiency. Federal spectrum users similarly lack competitive pressures promoting stakeholders to maximize the efficiency of this valuable public resource. The Commission should take these market forces into account as part of this proceeding and focus its investigation of spectrum utilization on bands where market incentives promoting spectral efficiency are lacking. The market incentives facing the commercial wireless industry, along with the Commission’s flexible use spectrum policies, have led to innovation and investment and enabled more intensive and efficient use of spectrum.  In 2022, wireless connections grew to nearly 523 million—or 1.6 connections for every person in the US.5  Moreover, U.S. wireless providers have increased their spectrum efficiency by a factor of 42 since 2010 on a MBs/MHz basis and  5 CTIA, 2023 Annual Survey Highlights, at 5 (July 25, 2023), https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-Annual-Survey.-Highlights.pdf (“CTIA 2023 Annual Survey Highlights”).",4,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4  have done so despite having access to much less critical mid-band spectrum allocated and licensed than their counterparts in other countries. 6  Commercial wireless providers provide high and consistent quality of service, interference protection, full power, and wide channels—allowing 5G commercial wireless networks relying on exclusive-use licenses to cover more than 315 million Americans.7  CTIA therefore urges the Commission to refrain from unnecessary data collection where competitive markets and industry cooperation have successfully ensured that spectrum is efficiently and effectively used. The wireless industry has made significant direct and indirect impacts on the U.S. GDP and job market, with wireless connectivity delivering increasing capabilities for verticals that are serving consumer, enterprise, and government needs.  Licensed, full-power spectrum has contributed more than $5 trillion to the U.S. economy in the last decade.8  In 2020 alone, the U.S. wireless industry, relying on full-power licensed spectrum, contributed $825 billion in GDP to America’s economy.9  Wireless investment has increased for the fifth year in a row, with a historic $39 billion invested in wireless networks in 2022—up nearly 12% from 2021’s previously record setting total.10  Over its history, the wireless industry has invested over $675 billion into its networks.11  Wireless-enabled jobs grew to 20.4 million by the end of the last  6 See Clearing the Air(waves): on 5G, Licensed Spectrum, Efficiencies, and Wireless Investment, CTIA BLOG (Nov. 16, 2020), https://www.ctia.org/news/blog-clearing-the-airwaves-on-5g-licensed-spectrum-efficiencies-and-wireless-investment.  7 CTIA, 2022 Annual Survey Highlights, at 6 (Sept. 13, 2022), https://www.ctia.org/news/2022-annual-survey-highlights (“CTIA 2022 Annual Survey Highlights”). 8 Aren Megerdichian,  The Importance of Licensed Spectrum and Wireless Telecommunications to the American Economy, COMPASS LEXECON, at 3 (Dec. 7, 2022), https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Compass-Lexecon-Licensed-Spectrum-Report.pdf. 9 Id. 10 CTIA 2023 Annual Survey Highlights at 4. 11 Id.",5,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

"6  The Commission seeks comment on data sources that could facilitate greater understanding of spectrum usage and asks for feedback on its existing data sources.17  CTIA urges the Commission to focus on existing data collections that govern non-exclusively licensed spectrum bands.  Specifically, CBRS and ICFS data can be further explored to understand spectrum usage and coverage. CBRS Data.  NTIA recently provided a report that analyzed the aggregate CBRS data from Spectrum Access System (“SAS”) Administrators.18  CTIA has previously provided suggestions in its comments on the NTIA report on how to better assess CRBS usage and coverage.19  More granular information from the SAS Administrators could be gathered (if not already provided), including geolocation and equivalent isotropically radiated power (“EIRP”) data for each device.  Making available additional CBRS data would be in the public interest, as CTIA’s recent investigation of CBRS usage has shown that its deployment is much less extensive than C-Band licenses.20 However, NTIA has not released any of the underlying data for review by the public, even though the Commission’s rules state that SAS Administrators must make available to the general public aggregated spectrum usage data for any geographic area.  Under the  17 Spectrum Usage NOI at 25-26.   18 NTIA, An Analysis of Aggregate CBRS SAS Data from April 2021 to January 2023, NTIA Report 23-567 (May 2023), https://its.ntia.gov/publications/details.aspx?pub=3311.    19 Letter from Thomas Power, Sr. Vice President and General Counsel, CTIA, to Charles Cooper, Acting Director, Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, NTIA, TR-23-567 (May 31, 2023), https://its.ntia.gov/media/yz2dhhjd/ctia-comments-on-ntia-tr-23-567.pdf.  CTIA continues to disagree with the methodology and conclusions reached by NTIA in its report. 20 See Doug Brake, CBRS Spectrum is Lightly Used, Whereas C-Band is Deployed Extensively,  CTIA BLOG (Sept. 25, 2023), https://www.ctia.org/news/cbrs-spectrum-is-lightly-used-whereas-c-band-deployed-extensively (noting that recent drive tests provide real-world evidence that CBRS spectrum is sparsely deployed in sharp contrast to widely deployed C-Band spectrum).  See also Recon Analytics, CBRS: An Unproven Spectrum Sharing Framework (Nov. 14, 2022), https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CBRS-Recon-Analytics.pdf.",7,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7  Commission’s rules, such information must include the total available spectrum and the maximum available contiguous spectrum in the requested area.21  Given that this information is spectrum usage data, and the Commission’s rules governing its collection by SAS Administrators already require its publication, CTIA encourages the Commission to explore whether and how this might be made available to the public, in anonymized fashion, to help guide this spectrum data usage inquiry while protecting competitively sensitive information.  For example, SAS Administrators have geolocation and EIRP data for each CBRS Device which, along with propagation models that account for local terrain, could identify aggregate coverage information with far better insight. ICFS Data. Space systems are required to provide technical information about their operations in the ICFS database. The Commission should explore how information from this database might be made more readily available to assess spectrum usage.  The ICFS web interface does not facilitate bulk engagement with application or license data. The results of advanced searches show a table of results with rows for individual file numbers which can then be individually analyzed through a manual tunneling exercise.  The downloadable ICFS database has not been updated for years, making it difficult or impossible to interact with space and earth station data.  To CTIA’s knowledge, it does not represent the ICFS database in its current form; the accompanying documentation file was last updated November 20, 1998. As such, to enable a better understanding of spectrum usage in satellite spectrum bands, the Commission should improve (and update) access to this already collected information.   CTIA therefore recommends that the Commission first investigate these existing and available data resources to better inform its spectrum usage inquiry.  21 47 C.F.R. § 96.55(a)(3).",8,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8  IV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD WORK WITH NTIA TO GATHER ADDITIONAL SPECTRUM USAGE INFORMATION FOR FEDERAL SPECTRUM. The Commission should work in collaboration with NTIA and federal agencies authorized in these bands to gather and provide spectrum usage information for these mid-band spectrum ranges.  Given NTIA’s oversight role for federal spectrum, the Commission should seek data gathered by NTIA on federal spectrum usage.  In addition, NTIA (as it has done for other federal spectrum bands in the past) could request additional spectrum usage information from federal agencies. The Commission should also consider the data gathered by NTIA for its Quantitative Assessment performed several years ago.22  While somewhat dated, this process provides a comprehensive view of specific bands and existing emitters for both location, time of day, and periodicity to give a good picture of band occupancy.  Specific measurements of occupancy in locations such as San Diego, Norfolk, Seattle, and New York were helpful in evaluating the 3.55-3.7 GHz band.  For the Commission’s inquiry into spectrum usage to be complete, CTIA recommends that it collect from NTIA and federal agencies additional information to provide a holistic understanding of the entirety of spectrum usage by all affected stakeholders. V. EXISTING COMMISSION DATA SOURCES SHOULD BE UTILIZED TO HELP ASSESS SPECTRUM USAGE METRICS. Once the Commission has made available to the public detailed usage information from the CBRS and ICFS databases it will be better positioned to create accurate spectrum usage metrics.  The NOI presents several examples of potential definitions for spectrum occupancy.23  NTIA and NIST defined “band occupancy” as “the percentage of frequencies or channels in the  22 NTIA, Quantitative Assessments of Spectrum Usage (2016), https://www.ntia.gov/report/2016/quantitative-assessments-spectrum-usage.   23 Spectrum Usage NOI at ¶¶ 17-21.",9,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9  band with a detected signal level that exceeds a default or user-defined threshold.”24  Occupancy has been characterized by NTIA as “at any given time . . . the fraction of frequencies (or channels) with a detected signal level that exceeds a predetermined threshold.”25  ITU defines “spectrum occupancy” as “the probability that, at a randomly selected moment in time, a radio channel, frequency band or other frequency resource being analyzed will be in use for the transmission of information.”26  The Commission also asks, “if utilization is defined as the exceedance of a power flux density (“PFD”), spectral occupancy, geographic, or other threshold,” how these values should be established and if they should vary by service or frequency range.27  The NOI also suggests that metrics beyond occupancy, such as throughput, population served, and number/density of end-user devices should also be considered.28 CTIA agrees that measurements of spectrum occupancy are multi-faceted and require careful consideration.  Assessments of spectrum occupancy should rely on credible and clearly defined metrics and include measures beyond occupancy to include components such as number of consumers served, geographic usage, frequency usage, and time usage.  For example, unlicensed low power devices utilizing Wi-Fi signals are spread spectrum (so may have great  24 Id. at ¶ 17 (citing Michael G.

The Commission also seeks comment on the cost and burden of collecting spectrum usage data and ways to minimize them.29  As noted above, CTIA recommends as a first step for the Commission to leverage its existing data resources for CBRS and ICFS.  In addition, if the Commission decides to explore other spectrum, CTIA urges the Commission to limit the scope of these data collections to spectrum bands that are being investigated for repurposing, with a particular focus on underutilized mid-band spectrum from 3-8 GHz.  Following these efforts, the Commission will have a better understanding of the costs and benefits of gathering spectrum usage information and can then look to other spectrum bands and collections as needed. VI. ANY SPECTRUM USAGE COLLECTIONS SHOULD BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO MINIMIZE PRIVACY SENSITIVITIES. The Commission asks how data protection, privacy, cybersecurity, or physical security should inform any study of spectrum utilization.30  As noted above, CTIA recommends that the Commission not request any new data collections but should instead rely upon existing data resources as an initial matter.  Should new spectrum usage collections be considered, they should be narrowly tailored to exclude customer proprietary and competitively sensitive information.  This would require that any spectrum usage data be aggregated and anonymized so that no wireless provider could readily be identified, and that consumer proprietary information (such as location or phone number) is not collected.  29 See id. at ¶ 29.  30 See id. at ¶ 40.",11,231003 Spectrum Usage NOI Comments (FINAL).pdf,CTIA – The Wireless Association,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"11  VII. CONCLUSION. CTIA encourages the Commission to prioritize improving data collection from existing resources and tailor spectrum usage information collection on a band-by-band basis.  The Commission should focus on obtaining spectrum usage information from bands lacking more intense and efficient use generated by the competitive incentives present in bands licensed for exclusive use.  Prioritizing collection from shared/unlicensed spectrum bands, exploring existing spectrum usage resources such as CBRS and the ICFS, and collaborating with NTIA will all position the Commission to better understand spectrum usage and, in turn, facilitate its more efficient use.  If the Commission does decide to collect new spectrum usage data, it should ensure any future collection is narrowly tailored to protect privacy and competitively sensitive information.

Summary 
The Association of Federal Communications Consulting Engineers (AFCCE)1 commends the 
Commission’ s inquiry into steps to better understand usage of Non-Federal radiofrequency 
spectrum. The knowledge attained will advance its management of the spectrum resource and 
benefit current and future users. In these comments we encourage the FCC’ s goal of “efforts to 
bring next-generation techniques and data-driven analysis” to better-inform future spectrum 
policy.  
1 AFCCE is a professional organization composed of members who provide technical, legal and other supporting roles 
in the communications industry to serve clients having matters under the purview of the Commission, including a 
significant number of members who are registered/licensed professional engineers.  AFCCE has worked together with 
the FCC for over 60 years to prov ide comments, guidance, and recommendations on such topics as matters of rule 
interpretation, technical collaboration, and assessing impact of FCC policy and implementation suggestions.",0,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232-Rev-Note.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Background 
Despite continuing advancements in transmission technology in recent decades a combination of 
congressional funding, leadership and workforce turnover, legacy information systems and 
physical relocation have limited the FCC’s ability to match spectrum development to a 
commensurate degree. For FY2024, the FCC requested a budget authority of $410,743,000, 
offsetting regulatory fee collections. This represents an increase of 5.3% from the FY2023 level, 
but is a modest request considering the magnitude of the agency's responsibilities. 
The FCC is tasked with multiple responsibilities such as regulating interstate and international 
communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Earlier this year a Space Bureau 
was established for satellite and space-based communications activity. The breadth and depth of 
the FCC’s responsibilities is immense and its importance in guiding and regulating the nation’s 
wireless and wireline communications is also immense. Optimal spectrum policy relies on the 
FCC’s gathering and ongoing analysis of spectrum usage data as described in the NOI. 
Band-Specific Techniques  
In order to better understand spectrum usage, the FCC needs to collect data in a variety of ways. 
AFCCE believes that data collection needs vary considerably by band type and usage.  For 
example, fixed point-to -point services are generally well-defined by the parameters required for 
FCC licensing a facility in these bands.  Spectrum usage can be analyzed from the geographic 
routes, bandwidth, power and modulation types in use.  However, time-of-use may require 
collecting information by survey from the operators. 
Fixed-t o-multipoint services illustrate a different case in which usage can vary dynamically by 
end-point locations and duty cycle of usage.  Remote monitoring of network usage is a 
cumbersome task, but could be used to verify system information collected by operators. 
A case in point is the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which refers to the unlicensed 
spectrum in the United States that can be leveraged for private 5G or private LTE networks, 
especially in urban settings. It consists of 150 MHz of valuable spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. 
There is an opportunity for private 5G/LTE networks to acquire some of this spectrum to support",1,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232-Rev-Note.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"® 
fixed wireless backhaul for carrier networks, whether it is fully used or not. This may affect 
efficien cy of use by others under General Authorized Access. Study of actual usage would help 
provide important metrics on rate of usage and geographic reach. This research would need a well -
designed field study.  
FCC Approach to Developing Studies and Collecting Information  
Given the frequency range, potentially from LF to millimeter-wave and the variety of spectrum 
usage styles, an investigation of usage should begin with scholarly studies to prepare for data 
collection. This undertaking may involve research universities or commercial research firms, and 
depends on first -hand expertise with a band usage, signal propagation , available user hardware and 
more.  
Investigative studies are difficult for the Commission to mount because of the time and resource 
demands on internal staff.  It may take several months or even years to collect and process the 
data.  Hiring expert, objective firms would  even the demands of on FCC staff and allow a 
supervisory role.  
An FCC contract of scientific research and the actual inventory process es by qualified , select ed 
organizations would also allow better planning and tracking of the FCC's e xpenses for th ese tasks.  
This would also allow the FCC to focus on its core mission of regulating interstate and foreign 
commerce in communication by radio, while also ensuring that the usage studies are conducted in 
a timely and cost -effective manner.  
In conclusion, the FCC needs to collect data on spectrum usage in a variety of ways in order to 
better understand how the spectrum is being used. The type of data collection needed will vary 
depending on the band type and usage. The FCC should consider hirin g expert, objective firms to 
conduct the research and data collection, as this would allow the FCC to focus on its core mission 
and ensure that the studies are conducted .",2,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232-Rev-Note.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

COMMENTS OF AEROSPACE AND FLIGHT TEST  
RADIO COORDINATING COUNCIL, INC. , ON THE NOTICE OF INQUIRY  
 
Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC""), hereby 
submits its comments on the Commission’s Notice of Inquiry (“NOI”) in the above -referenced 
proceeding.1   
I. SUMMARY  
AFTRCC is pleased to have the opportunity to offer initial observations on a number of 
the issues raised in t he NOI.  The Commission recognizes in the NOI that not all radio -based 
services utilize spectrum in similar enough ways to meaningfully measure spectrum usage using 
the same metrics.  AFTRCC agrees and takes this opportunity to remind the Commission how 
aeronautical mobile telemetry (“AMT”) is conducted by AFTRCC’s members and other 
aerospace companies engaged in flight testing, as well as Federal users, most significantly the 
Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NAS A”). 
The need for spectrum throughout our nation’s economy is more critical than ever, and 
ensuring that each industry is supported with the spectrum it requires now and in the future – as 
well as the sectors of the American economy, government (when appli cable), and the public that 
depend on that industry – must be a national priority.  Many industries are experiencing 
                                                   
1  In the Matter of Advancing Understanding of Non -Federal Spectrum Usage, Notice of 
Inquiry, WT Docket No. 232, FCC 23 -63 (rel. Aug 4, 2023) (“NOI”).",2,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"2 increasing spectrum demands which will require spectrum management decisions taking into 
account their differing characteristics.  Understa nding better the manner in which spectrum is 
utilized by various services and industry sectors, and the users within those sectors, would 
provide crucial data for the Commission – and its Federal counterpart, the National 
Telecommunications and Information  Administration (“NTIA”), as well as the Federal agencies 
NTIA supports – to make informed spectrum management decisions in the public interest.  Such 
data will be especially important as spectrum management decisions become increasingly 
complex due to the  generally more intensive demands placed on spectrum by virtually all radio 
services.  
However, as the Commission seeks to obtain additional spectrum usage data, it should 
avoid adopting or mandating standardized data sources across all service types as well as one -
size-fits-all approaches that might unintentionally skew regulatory deliberations and frameworks 
in favor of one category of uses over others.  Instead, AFTRCC urges the Commission to 
develop methods to collect and assess usage information that  reflects the differing characteristics 
of differing services so as to support unbiased decision -making.  Moreover, within shared non -
Federal or Federal/non -Federal bands, including those AMT bands in which AFTRCC Members 
and other aerospace companies cond uct flight testing, the Commission should pursue a holistic 
approach to obtaining improved spectrum usage information that accounts for the interrelated 
usage of all users and services enjoying access to the bands.",3,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 II. INTRODUCTION:  AFTRCC AND FLIGHT TESTIN G 
A. AFTRCC and Its Coordination Responsibilities  
AFTRCC is an association of the nation’s principal aerospace manufacturers.  See 
Exhibit A hereto, reflecting AFTRCC’s current membership.  AFTRCC was founded in 1954 
and serve s as an advocate for the aerospac e industry on matters affecting spectrum policy, in 
particular flight testing of both military and commercial aircraft, including the new generation of 
sophisticated fixed wing, rotorcraft, and uncrewed aircraft (“UAs”) serving a growing host of 
functions.   AFTRCC’s Members, and other aerospace companies, as explained in more detail 
below, use spectrum during flight testing activities both for relaying essential telemetry data in 
real-time, but also for voice communications between pilots and the ground dur ing testing. 
Without interference -free access to adequate spectrum for these purposes, flight testing would be 
much less efficient and much less safe.  The consequences of inadequate access to reliable non -
Federal spectrum to support flight test operations  for military aviation and commercial passenger 
and transport aviation, not to mention private aviation and the use of UAs, would be substantial 
and have adverse ripple effects for our national security and the country’s economic prosperity.   
AFTRCC and i ts members are intimately familiar with how flight testing uses spectrum. 
AFTRCC serves as the recognized non -Federal Government coordinator for the shared 
Government/Non -Government spectrum allocated on a primary, safety -of-life basis for flight 
testing o f crewed aircraft, missiles, and UAs in both the 1435 -1525 MHz and 2360 -2395 MHz 
aeronautical mobile telemetry (“AMT”) bands.2  In conducting its coordination activity, 
AFTRCC works in close collaboration with Government Area Frequency Coordinators 
                                                   
2  AFTRCC also coordinates flight test radio frequency communications in the HF Band 
(2851.0 -21931.0 kHz), VHF Band (123.125 -123.575 MHz), and C -Band (5091 -5150 MHz).",4,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 (“AFCs” ), who are responsible for Department of Defense use of radio frequency spectrum.3  
This collaboration is critical to ensuring that both Federal and non -Federal flight test operations 
are protected from harmful interference, and flight safety and operation al efficiency are 
maximized for both military and civil flight tests.4 
AFTRCC has promoted sharing wherever possible, but that sharing cannot be at the 
expense of ready and reliable access to sufficient spectrum to support flight testing, even if usage 
is not 24/7.  Indeed, AFTRCC currently coordinates multiple other non -Federal spectrum uses in 
and adjacent to 1435 -1525 and 2360 -2395 MHz that enable other, disparate users to access these 
bands, on the condition that they operate in a manner that does not c ause interference to non -
Federal and Federal  flight testing.  For example, AFTRCC is the FCC -designated AMT 
coordinator for secondary medical body area network use of the AMT  spectrum at 2360 -2390 
MHz.5  AFTRCC is also responsible under the FCC’s Rules for coordination with the Wireless 
Communications Services (“WCS”) licensee – AT&T – in the subjacent 2345 -2360 MHz band.6  
Over the past several years, AFTRCC has successfully coordinated thousands of WCS  cell sites 
with an even larger number of antenna sectors to ensure protection of flight test operations in the 
                                                   
3  The Government AFCs also coordinate with NASA with regard to NASA’s use of certain 
freque ncies.

operations within the shared Federal and non -Federal AMT Band on the designated S -Band 
frequencies 2364.5 MHz, 2370.5 MHz, and 2382.5 MHz.  Additionally, AFTRCC has been

1435 -1525 MHz and 2360 -2395 MHz AMT bands, giving others the opportunity, subject to the 
priority of flight test operations a nd other licensed uses, to utilize the band.  
B. The Significance of Flight Testing to the Aerospace Industry, Its 
Customers, and the Nation  
Flight testing plays a key role in the nation’s world -leading aerospace industry, 
supporting the design, development, d elivery, and upgrades to civilian and military aircraft, 
increasingly including UAs.  The contributions of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry are 
vital to the national economy.  In 2022, the aerospace and defense industry supported over 2.2 
million U. S. jobs – approximately 1.47% of total national employment – many of them highly -
compensated and highly -skilled positions with an average salary of over $108,900, about 55% 
above the national average.  The aerospace and defense industry generated $952 bill ion in 
economic output in 2022 (a 6.7% increase year over year) and produced $418 billion in 
economic value – 1.65% of total nominal U.S. GDP.  The aerospace and defense industry 
contributed a trade surplus of approximately $77.3 billion (based on exports of $104.8 billion 
minus imports).8  These data generally represent healthy increases over 2021 figures.

"6 Flight testing using dedicated non -Federal AMT spectrum is in the critical path for the 
success of the United States military and the civil aviation ind ustry.  Aircraft that depend on 
flight testing throughout their life cycles are key to the country’s national security, critical 
infrastructure, transportation, emergency response and public safety, and, generally, its economic 
growth.  Flight testing is c ritical for the design, development, testing, delivery, and completion of 
numerous upgrades, modification, and other test requirements that occur during the life cycle of 
aircraft.  These tasks occur subsequent to development and introduction of the aircra ft, and 
extend over the life of individual models of military crewed aircraft, missiles, and other UAs.  
Flight testing is equally essential for the introduction, upgrades, and modifications of 
conventional aircraft to ensure they are safe and operationall y efficient, and equally so for the 
next generation of aircraft using green, sustainable fuels or powered by electricity, as well as 
increasingly sophisticated uncrewed aircraft systems, from smaller drones to, eventually, 
passenger -carrying aircraft.   
C. The Conduct of Flight Tests and Importance of Spectrum Access to 
Their Success  
Successful and comprehensive flight testing precedes delivery of aircraft by AFTRCC 
Members and other manufacturers and assemblers in the aerospace and aviation industries to 
their civil and government customers.  Government customers often conduct additional flight 
tests of these aircraft once they are delivered.  While some systems can be tested, to a degree,

"7 when aircraft are on the ground,9 only rigorous flight tests in the air  can ensure an aircraft is truly 
ready for operations.   
The nearly 150 non -Federal licensed AMT sites in the continental U.S. are widely 
disbursed.  Non -Federal AMT ground station sites operate in 30 of the lower 48 states, and, in 
over 70% of those state s, there are multiple -- and, in a number of states, many -- AMT sites.  In 
addition, the Federal Government operates an even larger number of AMT sites.   Both non -
Federal and Federal flight test ranges are large, with sensitive AMT ground stations receivi ng 
telemetry sent from test aircraft  often hundreds of kilometers away.   
Flight tests are typically large, complicated, and costly logistical and operational 
exercises.  Frequently, civil and government flight tests require the coordinated, concurrent 
activity of scores of engineers, test, and other support personnel, a wide variety of range 
equipment (including AMT ground stations), search and rescue aircraft (and their pilots and 
ground crews), chase planes (and their pilots and ground crews), and variou s ground vehicles and 
their operators, just to name only some of the principal elements.  Flight test costs for advanced 
aircraft can easily exceed $1 million per flight, and flight testing can cumulatively represent as 
much as 15 -20% of the cost of develo ping new aircraft.  The more data that can be collected per 
test flight, the fewer the test flights required to ensure aircraft and missile performance, 
efficiency, and safety, and the lower the total cost of the aircraft.  The aircraft make their way to 
market and operational use more quickly when flight tests are conducted on time.  Conversely, 
flight test delays mean delays in delivery to customers.   
                                                   
9  Examples of some tests that can be conducted on the ground are br ake testing, aborted 
takeoff testing, and equipment calibration.",8,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 A central characteristic of flight testing’s use of spectrum is the importance of data and 
other informa tion (such as video) being received in real -time to allow operational decisions to be 
made by the flight test teams.  The telemetry data and video received on the ground in real -time 
is used to determine whether to continue or abort a flight test, or a por tion of it, when an anomaly 
or unplanned situation arises.  Thus, interference -free delivery of telemetry information from the 
test aircraft and voice communications with the pilot is vital for the safety of the pilot, as well as 
protecting persons on the ground and property.10  It is important that the AMT allocations, while 
shared bands , as explained above, are always ready for reliable access and use by non -Federal 
and Federal flight test operations.  For this reason, both the 1435 -1525 and 2360 -2395 MHz 
AMT bands are restricted, safety -of-life bands.  On the other hand, the data and video received 
by ground operations in command of the flight test may also lead to a decision extending a flight 
test beyond what was initially planned or to add additional ma neuvers, so as to take advantage of 
the considerable personnel and resources that have been assembled to conduct the flight test.      
There is an ever increasing number of measurements – and a corresponding increase in 
the required frequency and precision  of such measurements – required during flight testing.  
Video telemetry feeds during flight testing are more and more common.11   The resulting 
                                                   
10  Real-time telemetry data is equally important for missiles and UAs undergoing flight 
testing.  
11  Digital video cameras represent an increasingly important source of real -time data and 
moni toring information for both crewed and uncrewed (e.g., missiles) test flights, adding to 
flight testing’s dependence on spectrum.  Multiple video streams showing critical platform 
components may be required depending on the test.  Cameras complement tradit ional sensors, 
offering ""pictures"" that other sensors cannot capture.  Video can be synchronized with other 
instrumentation to record the movements of ""tufts,"" or ""strings"" glued to the aircraft skin, visibly 
indicating the direction of air flow over the s urface of the aircraft at every instant during flight 
maneuvers, thereby providing insight for design changes to increase performance and efficiency.  
Video provides other benefits explaining its increasing use, such as the ability to closely observe 
the interaction of water and tires during wet runway testing, monitoring of ice build -up on 
control surfaces during icing tests, and determining the time lag on cockpit avionics displays.  
Video is also used for monitoring weapons separation tests and scoring, and for an over -the-
shoulder view of the instrument panel during crewed flight -tests as seen by the pilot. The latter is",9,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 increase in data throughput requirements has increased dramatically spectrum demand to meet 
AMT needs for both F ederal Government and non -Federal Government flight testing.  Modern 
aircraft and missiles are designed to operate closer to the point of maximum efficiency, and they 
require more telemetry data and more extensive testing.  Certification of next generation  
commercial aircraft is expected to require data rates in the 100 to 200 Mbps range.  While flight 
testing of the Boeing 707 required measurement of a few hundred data points, flight testing for 
the 787 required more than 100,000.   
Bottom line, interferen ce-free access to adequate and “always ready” flight test spectrum 
in the AMT bands is a fundamental element of all flight tests.  There is no Plan B if spectrum is 
unavailable for a flight test when it is scheduled.  The demand for new aircraft and the 
integration of updated equipment, and correspondingly tighter development and delivery cycles, 
puts stress on the existing AMT spectrum resources for non -Federal flight testing, i.e., the 1435 -
1525 and 2360 -2395 MHz Bands.  Unfortunately, delays due to spect rum shortages are 
becoming more frequent, and these can impose heavy logistical costs on both manufacturers and 
their customers – and ultimately the country’s national defense and economic interests.12  When 
                                                   
utilized when trying to capture pilot workload so as to inform efficient and ergonomic instrument 
panel design: high definition video c an show flight test engineers on the ground what the pilot 
sees, and how he or she is reacting to the various gauges, warning lights, and other visual and 
auditory inputs.   
12  The experiences of AFTRCC Members underscore these points.  AFTRCC offers two 
examples here.  One AFTRCC Member, testing uncrewed vehicles, notes that measurements 
collected during flight testing of this next generation of aircraft have tripled in just the past five 
years, resulting in more flight tests flown for longer periods.  Bec ause of bandwidth constraints, 
it has been necessary during individual flights to switch between multiple data collection sources 
to focus on different parts of the system.  This demand for measurements is expected to continue 
as uncrewed vehicles become i ncreasingly complex and autonomous, and tests involving 
multiple flight test articles simultaneously become more common.  Furthermore, these flight tests 
are generally integral to aircraft certification projects of new platforms, thus providing additional 
significant value to manufacturers and operators.  The increasingly common lack of adequate 
spectrum resources when requested has delayed the completion of flight tests and the delivery of 
test results to customers.",10,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"10 the customer is the Department of Defense, delays  can blunt our nation’s competitive edge 
against foreign adversaries.  When the customer is the commercial aviation industry or private 
customers, delays impact the flying public and the movement of goods, in other words, the 
efficiency of the economy.13 
                                                   
Another AFTRCC Member has observed tha t, in the case of flight testing of uncrewed high -
altitude balloons (which may extend over a long period), multiple video streams are often used 
showing different components of the balloon structure, parachute, and flight vehicle.  Without, or 
with inadequ ate levels of, digital video during tests due to spectrum limitations, all safety -critical 
components cannot be monitored by operators during flight tests of new or upgraded systems.  
Lack of spectrum in available AMT allocations has limited the incorporat ion of these multiple 
video feeds into flight testing, reducing the effectiveness of the test and increasing risk and the 
need for more tests.  Whether testing crewed or uncrewed vehicles, video inputs such as those 
described above are merged with the rest  of the flight test telemetry stream, improving the 
efficiency and efficacy of the ground operations, but also adding significantly to the spectrum 
requirement.  
13  AFTRCC Members report that access to the two non -Federal bands allocated for flight 
testing has become increasingly difficult in many locations due to testing demands by other 
users, government and non -government (as well as other uses).  The need to meet customer 
requirements and conduct tests on or overlapping with government customer ranges ha s led to 
scheduling constraints.  For these reasons, some AFTRCC Members have been using the 4400 -
4940 MHz band for flight tests, a Federal Government band currently used intensively for 
Government flight testing, among a number of other Federal mission ty pes.  Other Members note 
that, increasingly, government contracts require contractor testing in 4400 -4940 MHz for flight 
tests before aircraft delivery.  In the current absence of a non -Federal AMT allocation  in this 
band , manufacturers have had to rely on  Part 5 experimental licenses and operate on a non -
interference basis with licensed users, an untenable situation for flight testing operations in the 
long run, especially as use of the band increases for Federal flight testing as well as other uses.  
In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ET Docket No. 15 -99, the Commission proposed 
to allocate 4400 -4940 MHz for non -Federal AMT implementing the 2012 World 
Radiocommunication Conference (“WRC -12”) on this matter.  AFTRCC filed comments and 
reply comments i n support (and it and its Members have met multiple times with the 
Commission seeking that outcome).  The Commission confirmed in 2017, when subsequently 
implementing certain decisions of WRC -12, that it planned to address the issue of the 4400 MHz 
band fo r non -Federal AMT in a subsequent order.   Amendment of Parts 2, 15, 80, 90, 87, and

4400 -4940 MHz band can be accomplished through shared Federal/non -Federal AMT use of the 
band (in addition to other existing Federal uses within these frequencies) wi thout significant 
transition costs and preserving incumbent, critical Federal missions through coordination which 
already occurs so successfully in the 1435 -1525 and 2360 -2395 MHz bands.   Significantly,

"11 D. While Shared Federal/Non -Federal AMT Bands Are Primarily Used for 
Flight Testing, There Are Demands Placed by Other Spectrum Users.  
Flight testing is accorded the highest priority to the AMT bands at 1435 -1525 MHz and 
2360 -2395 MHz.  Yet these are shared ban ds.  First and foremost, non -Federal flight testing 
shares the band with Federal flight testing conducted by the Federal government on Federal 
ranges.  This can create scheduling conflicts when AFTRCC Members and other aerospace 
companies seek to access th e band and use the airspace over Federal flight testing ranges.   
AFTRCC works with its government counterparts, the Area Frequency Coordinators, to 
deconflict access to the spectrum for this primary purpose.  
Increasingly, other users seek to access the 14 35-1525 and 2360 -2395 MHz bands, 
putting further pressure on the use of these bands for non -Federal flight testing, and creating the 
potential for even further delays to complete flight test requirements.  As noted above, AFTRCC 
has been coordinating reque sts to use these bands to support commercial space launches, which 
are occurring with ever greater frequency.14  Indeed, on September 21, 2023, the Commission 
issued a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket 13 -115 seeking comment on the 
prospect of  increasing access to these bands for commercial space launches, while 
acknowledging the heavy use of the bands for flight testing.  The two non -Federal AMT bands 
are also available for several secondary uses which must be coordinated, as explained above.  
Finally, certain adjacent band operations also present coexistence challenges for flight testing 
which AFTRCC has collaboratively explored with the users in those adjacent bands.15 
                                                   
14  Once notifications of these launches have been entered into the Integrated Frequency 
Deconfliction System (“IFDS”), the frequencies become unavailable for flight testing over an 
extended area.  In AFTRCC’s experience as coordinator, such users often ask for access to a 
large portion of the affected band.  
15  For example, AFTRCC has entered into coordination agreements with AT&T regarding 
coexistence between its WCS operations and flight testing in the 2360 -2395 MHz band; and with",12,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"12 It bears emphasizing that even when the scheduling of a non -Federal flight test is 
successful from a spectrum coordination perspective, there are other significant non -spectrum -
access related factors outside the control of the flight test operator that can impact whether a 
flight test can go off when intended (and the flight test  spectrum is used when intended).  The 
availability of suitable airspace may come into play.  As noted above, individual flight tests take 
place over large distances from the receive ground stations.  Flight tests are also subject to 
temporary rerouting of  Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) flight corridors through FAA -
designated test areas due to inclement weather or other circumstances.  Similarly, flight tests may 
be subject to constraints (apart from spectrum access) due to the need to schedule acc ess to 
airspace associated with Federal test ranges.  Further, some flight tests require certain weather 
conditions to be present to perform successfully – such as testing in particular temperatures, 
winds, or precipitation.  Other unexpected weather condi tions may cause other flight tests to be 
scrubbed.   And, in most cases, flight testing is only conducted during daylight hours.   
In sum, as explained herein, considerations of how non -Federal flight testing operations 
utilize the spectrum available for t hose purposes in the 1435 -1525 MHz and 2360 -2395 MHz 
bands must take into account the shared nature of these bands as a whole and the non -spectrum 
constraints placed on flight testing.  It is the very nature of flight testing that has permitted, after 
careful consideration and collaboration, other uses of the bands which enables more intensive 
spectrum use as a whole.

"13 III. DISCUSSION OF THE NOI  
As a general spectrum management positions, AFTRCC concurs in the Commission’s 
broad motivation in launching the NOI: “[a]s the radiofrequency (RF) environment grows more 
congested,” . . . a better understanding of “spectrum usage [to] help identify new opportunities to 
facilitate more efficient spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and 
approaches to en able co -existence among users and services” is essential to making sound 
spectrum management decisions. 16 As described above, flight testing takes place in shared AMT 
bands that are heavily used and increasingly are becoming more congested.  AFTRCC has, 
historically, been open to proposals to allow for more intensive use of these two bands provided 
that primary, safety -of-life AMT operations are protected, as explained above.  Any further 
proposals to introduce new uses into, or expand currently permitted u ses in, those two bands or 
immediately adjacent bands merit close scrutiny to determine whether such actions would 
threaten to compromise effective and interference -free flight test operations.17   
A. Any Consideration of Spectrum Usage to Improve Spectrum 
Management Decisions Should Holistically Consider All Users and 
Services.  
The NOI explains that the Commission seeks “actionable information” through the “right 
analytic tools” applied to spectrum usage data to assist it with future spectrum management

"14 decisions.18  AFTRCC submits that the starting point – collecting usage data within a specific 
band – requires a comprehensive and integrated view of the range of services using, and 
authorized to use, the radiofrequency spectrum.   
In order for the Commission  to achieve its objectives of making more data -driven and 
informed spectrum management decisions,19 spectrum usage by all relevant services should be 
considered and certain data regarding projected use of existing and new entrant services should 
also be gen erated and made available for consideration.  The Commission should not only focus 
on spectrum bands that might be candidates for the introduction of additional services, but 
spectrum which is already allocated for use by the types of services that might s eek access to 
additional spectrum.  Any industry sector seeking greater access to new spectrum bands should 
demonstrate the need to access more spectrum, although the data and information justifying 
change may differ across services and bands, and may go b eyond mere quantitative measures of 
use.20   How efficiently and how intensely existing spectrum resources are being used by 
proponents of new allocations21 is equally as important as the intensity of use by incumbents 
                                                   
18  NOI ¶ 33.  
19  See id. ¶ 2.   
20  As some examples, if other spectrum bands support similar uses by the industry sector 
seeking access to new spectrum,  how heavily used are those bands (including by other services, 
if shared)?  Can the technologies in the existing bands be updated to support additional use?  Are 
there other factors that favor repurposing bands or adding new allocations, e.g., in the case  of 
flight testing, government contracts requiring that contractors perform testing and other AMT -
related operations at their own sites within specific bands not currently allocated for non -Federal 
AMT to support the relevant federal programs?  Are there r easonable and practical methods 
available that have not been used that could be employed to increase intensity of use within 
existing spectrum, such as greater network densification and frequency reuse? See id.  ¶ 20 
(inquiring what is the ability to employ  techniques to improve efficiency and maximize usage of 
spectrum).  
21  In response to NOI questions as to the best way to generate usage data ( see id.  ¶ 36), 
AFTRCC submits that licensees would also have the best sense as to how to sample spectrum 
usage in a way that develops actionable data relative to their service type.  The Commission, as it 
considers how best to obtain usage data, should consider that much usage data is (or can be) 
generated simply by the operation of a service – that data, in some mean ingful form, could",15,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"15 (and whether what some proponents would  characterize as a “repurposing” of the spectrum is 
even technically feasible) in bands that might be considered as candidates for change in 
allocations.  Thus, exclusive -use licensees, for example, seeking access to new spectrum bands 
cannot simply be pre sumed to have sufficiently maximized use of spectrum already allocated and 
authorized, particularly over all geographies and frequencies and times.  AFTRCC submits that 
any such presumption creates the risk of spectrally inefficient spectrum management dec isions.22  
B. The Differing Characteristics of Services and Bands Should Be 
Accounted for and One -Size-Fits-All Approaches Avoided.  
The best way to obtain and interpret spectrum usage data will differ by spectrum band 
and the service(s) authorized within the b and.   Not all spectrum uses are susceptible to uniform 
treatment in terms of assessing intensity of spectrum uses.  AFTRCC notes that the Commission 
recognizes that different spectrum bands present different service requirements, operational 
systems, and technical characteristics.23  The NOI also importantly acknowledges that some 
bands may “exhibit infrequent usage,” by some measures, although highly reliable access to the 
bands is mission critical for “their intended uses” by the authorized licensees.24  The NOI 
mentions public safety bands, as one case that may exhibit these characteristics.  AFTRCC notes 
that a number of aviation and aerospace uses also require access to reliable, interference -free 
spectrum when required to achieve high performance, even if such spectrum is not used 
continuously in a given location.  In a subset of such cases, such as flight testing in the non -
                                                   
potentially be made available by licensees in different bands taking into account the needs for 
privacy and confidentiality and protecting competitively sensitive information.  
22  For instance, such a presumption would tend to preclude ev en the prospect of spectrum 
sharing (setting aside licensee -driven spectrum leases) and render the actual usage of the existing 
exclusive spectrum irrelevant to future spectrum management decisions.  
23  See id. ¶ 22.  
24  Id.",16,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"16 Federal/Federal shared AMT bands, the pattern of usage under the primary AMT allocation has 
created opportunities for access by oth er users on a secondary basis; this allows the bands, which 
are now increasingly congested, to be used more intensely by multiple users and systems taken 
as a whole.  See Section II, supra . 
Bands that have been auctioned to exclusive -use licensees present a very different picture 
regarding spectrum usage than shared bands, especially shared bands accommodating a variety 
of disparate services.  Exclusive -use licensees operating coverage -type networks for subscriber 
usage allow for a potentially complete view  of spectrum usage within their licensed spectrum 
and geographic area of operation by focusing only on a single licensee within a given spectrum 
range.  Nonetheless, challenges remain even when there is a single licensee in a band, including 
questions rela ted to varying usage over time and, as the NOI recognizes, different usage in 
different geographic areas.  Moreover, usage in one band in which a service provider operator is 
licensed may be coupled in the same geographic area with spectrum in other bands also licensed 
to the same operator to provide similar services to customers using multi -band radios.  Thus, 
understanding usage in more than one band may be necessary to obtaining meaningful and 
actionable information about usage of the spectrum in any of the interrelated bands in such 
cases.25 
In shared bands, by contrast, collection of usage data cannot focus solely on individual 
licensees, but each licensee’s usage must be considered in combination with usage by others that 
have access to the same frequen cies in the same or overlapping geometries (and timeframes).  
The multiple licensees and services in a shared band present a “collection of systems” which 
                                                   
25  An analogous idea, although a pplied to spectrum holdings rather than spectrum usage, 
per se , underlies spectrum screens that consider holdings across multiple bands.",17,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"17 must be considered collectively when collecting usage data.26  Consequently, in a shared 
environment, usage by individual spectrum users should not be isolated from others in the band.  
The risk is a false picture that would suggest individual licensees are not using “their” spectrum 
“fully” or “efficiently” masking the prospect that the usage of the band,  as a whole, may be quite 
intense and that any additional usage by the existing users or new users may be quite challenging 
or even, as a practical matter, effectively impossible.  Moreover, in a shared environment, 
compatibility and cooperation among the different spectrum uses is as, if not more, important to 
understand spectrum usage than some pure aggregation of individual spectrum usage data.27 
To illustrate this further, non -Federal flight test operations in either the 1435 -1525 MHz 
or 2360 -2395 MHz ba nd must be coordinated with other users which can put restrictions on the 
access non -Federal flight testing has to the spectrum.  For one, Federal AMT usage may restrict 
non-Federal AMT access in the L - and S -bands within the large geographies of Federal f light test 
ranges depending on the schedule of Federal flight test operations.  Coordination among 
AFTRCC and the Government Area Frequency Coordinators will determine when and where 
non-Federal flight testing can occur in the band.  In addition, commercia l space launch uses that 
                                                   
26  See id.  ¶ 37.  
27  AFTRCC submits that notions of “efficient” spectrum usage ( see NOI ¶ 17) should only 
follow collect ion of data regarding actual usage and must take into account the specific 
characteristics of the services involved, including whether a service supports a critical mission 
that requires “always ready” spectrum.   Concepts of “efficient use of spectrum” ar e often 
heavily burdened by certain assumptions that hold up one type of service over other disparate 
services as the paradigm of efficiency, something AFTRCC urges the Commission to avoid in 
making spectrum management decisions.  At the same time, AFTRCC agrees that the 
Commission should encourage all licensee generally to improve and maximize use of the 
spectrum available to them.  Questions to consider are whether spectrum is used in a way that 
allows increased usage by the same licensee or sharing of th e spectrum with another licensee of 
the same service or with users of another service.   AFTRCC, in the non -Federal and Federal 
shared AMT bands and with regard to adjacent spectrum, has long been a proponent of shared 
use, and has explored numerous opport unities for shared use, as reflected earlier in these 
comments, to the point that the bands in which it operates are congested.",18,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"18 AFTRCC may coordinate in the 2360 -2395 MHz band (which includes back -up launch windows 
over time) can restrict AMT usage of bands in certain frequencies, within certain time windows, 
throughout the “cones” of th e expected launch op erations.  As a practical matter, while 
commercial launch operations are technically secondary to flight testing operations, both Federal 
and non -Federal, once a space launch has been coordinated, the spectrum, as dictated by the 
coordinated space launch u se, becomes unavailable for flight testing  over potentially large areas 
during the scheduled launch windows .  Moreover, as explained above, circumstances outside the 
control of flight test operators can restrict their access to spectrum, such as weather (w hich must 
be appropriate for the type s of tests being conducted) and time of day (most flight test operations 
must occur during the day), and so forth.  
C. Data Sources and Criteria for Spectrum Usage Should Be Standardized 
Only for Subsets of Sufficiently Sim ilar Authorized Services.  
The NOI asks whether data sources should be standardized across services.  Because of 
the need to consider the mix of services utilizing the band in a holistic manner when attempting 
to assess spectrum usage, AFTRCC questions the extent to which, as a general matter, data 
sources and criteria for assessing intensity of use can be standardized.28   A one -size-fits-all 
approach applied to all services based on data throughput measured over frequencies, space, and 
time would not be jus tified because the arrays of transmitters and receivers in coverage 
networks, and their ability to reuse spectrum based on the density of deployment, can contrast 
quite sharply with other services using spectrum for very different purposes.  Flight tests, for 
example, typically involve a relatively small number of receive ground stations located centrally 
within a flight test range, which may extend for hundreds of kilometers over wide azimuths.  
                                                   
28  See id. ¶ 31.",19,AFTRCC Oct 3 Comments on Spectrum Usage.pdf,"Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council, Inc. (""AFTRCC"")",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"19 Flight test transmission of real -time telemetry data involves  very low signal levels and high gain 
antennas.  This is in sharp contrast with commercial wireless and other services with network 
type deployments and large numbers of subscribers and user equipment deployed throughout a 
service area.  
For this reason, br oadly -applied criteria for whether a band is intensely used or not, such 
as a uniform power flux density threshold,29 should not be adopted for services across the board, 
although there may be some subsets of services which share similar characteristics for  which 
uniform criteria – such as throughput, population actually or potentially served, and the density 
of end -user points30 – might be meaningful.  AFTRCC acknowledges that certain metrics may be 
suitable for measuring spectrum usage by coverage -type comm ercial wireless services but these 
are not readily transferable to other services, such as flight testing.  
AFTRCC is concerned that any attempt by the Commission to standardize data sources 
over all services would gloss over important differences between s ervices which could inevitably 
(even if inadvertently) introduce some level of bias that would lead to spectrum decisions that 
unjustifiably favor some services and disfavor others.  Therefore, AFTRCC believes that the 
Commission should consider developing  different approaches for studying spectrum utilization 
based on the licensing and usage characteristics of the full mix of users appropriate to the band 
or bands in question.31   That said, AFTRCC wishes to be clear that additional utilization data 
from services across all industries  would be of benefit to the Commission in its spectrum 
management decision -making.  While no service should be immune from a meaningful measure

flux density, spectra l occupancy, geographic, or other threshold should be adopted).

"20 
and evaluation of its spectrum usage, those steps must take into account the specifi cs of that 
service, and other services with which it coexists.32  Development of this type of understanding 
will support better spectrum management decisions.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
AFTRCC concurs with the Commission that a better understanding of spectrum usage 
will e nhance spectrum management decision -making by the agency.  However, as the 
Commission seeks to obtain spectrum usage data, it should avoid standardized data sources 
across all service types and shy away from one -size-fits-all approaches that could inject b iases 
into regulatory deliberations and frameworks that inadvertently favor one category of uses over 
others.  Instead, AFTRCC urges the Commission to develop methods to collect and assess usage 
information that reflects the differing characteristics of di ffering services.  Moreover, within 
shared bands, a holistic approach is necessary that considers, in combination, the usage of all 
users and services enjoying access to the bands.

believes that all services are susceptible to efforts to understand better how intensely the 
spectrum is being used according to frequency, space, and geography, which in turn affects if

"1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY  
NCTA – The Internet & Television Association (“NCTA”)1 commends the Commission 
for seeking  to gain greater insight into non- Federal spectrum us e through its recent Notice of 
Inquiry (“NOI”).2  As the Commission recognizes , accurate and reliable data play a central  role 
in driving s pectrum policy decisions .3  In considering new ways to collect and utilize such data, 
we agree with  the Commission that a single, generic  approach would not be best suited to 
achieve the Commission’s goals, as it will not accurately  measure spectrum use and utility.  As 
the NOI  notes, “[s]pectrum bands do not have uniform service requirements, operational 
systems, or technical characteristics,”4 and “[t]here is not a one -size-fits-all approach to 
measuring spectrum usage.”5   
Further, different types of data are required to achieve different Commission goals , such 
as determining compliance with existing rules versus making policy decisions about  the 
comparative benefits of different uses of a band .  For example, policy decisions concerning the

"2 best use of a band should consider the total utility a  spectrum use produces , including 
measurements of  how much total data is being carried by a particula r spectrum range across all 
users in an area compared to other potential uses.  Different measurement data may be needed 
for this purpose compared to a determination of whether existing users are complying with the 
Commission’s  rules.  
NCTA, therefore , recommends that the Commission use this proceeding to develop a 
framework for gathering measurement data when it needs such data for a particular proceeding, purpose, or band, rather than adopting any single approach for all its needs.   
To develop this frame work, the Commission should incorporate  three  key principles.   
• First , any measurement approach should be tailored to the Commission’s intended 
use of the data .  For example, a measurement effort to determine compliance with 
existing rules would be different than an effort to inform a proceeding considering 
different uses of a band.  
 
• Second, any analytic approach employed by the Commission should be neutral to avoid over - or undervalu ing a particular service or technology .  A measurement 
approach tha t assumes a particular use, or fails to recognize differences between 
technologies, will likely produce unreliable results, especially if it mistakes received power as a proxy for utility.  
• Third , usage measurement, while important to policymaking, should not become a 
tool for blocking Commission action.  The Commission should not enable opponents of change to draw out a measurement campaign to delay or deny access to a band by 
new users.  
 Finally, NCTA agrees  with the NOI  that the Commission does  not need to develop a 
completely new measurement approach to make changes that will substantially improve the 
understanding of  spectrum us e.  The Commission can greatly enhance access to data on spectrum 
use by improving the usability and content  of its existing spectrum databases.   This would not 
only provide the Commission and the marketplace with better data for traditional analysis but",3,NCTA - Non-Federal Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,NCTA – THE INTERNET & TELEVISION ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 would also provide a more complete and reliable foundation for analysis using machine learning 
and artificial intelligence too ls. 
I. MEASUREMENT APPROACHES SHOULD BE TAILORED TO THE 
COMMISSION’S INTENDED USE OF THE DATA.  
While the NOI establishes a broad goal of leveraging  measurement approaches and data 
to “advance [the Commission’s ] understand ing of non- Federal spectrum usage,”6 different 
approaches to measurement may be required depending on the intended use  of such data .  For 
example , the Commission may seek  data to improve its understanding of compliance with 
existing rules concerning buildout, transmission power, out -of-band e missions, or geographic 
exclusion zones protecting government radar or radioastronomy sites.  Alternatively, it may seek 
data to evaluat e the utility of incumbent band use, or the geographic, temporal, or frequency- use 
dynamics of incumbent use, in order t o inform decision -making about spectrum sharing or a 
proposed alternative use.   These two uses of measurement data would require different types of 
data collection .  A rigid pre -established measurement approach is unlikely to provide the 
flexibility needed  to generate appropriate and reliable data for both purposes.  Instead, the  
Commission  should adopt a framework adaptable enough to recognize and account for these 
difference s, whether the Commission  seeks data from interested parties, from third parties or 
academic sources, or conducts its own measurement or analysis.  
In developing its approach, the Commission should draw on other federal agencies’  data 
collection experiences.  The NOI  recognizes tha t data collection efforts  are ri fe with challenges, 
such as significant costs in collecting the data, difficulties in ensuring the data are standardized 
and accurate, and challenges in establishing robust  security measures to protect sensitive data.7

"4 The National Telecommunications  and Information Administration’s  (“NTIA”) Institute for 
Telecommunication Sciences (“I TS”), the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(“NIST”), the National Science Foundation, and other organizations have confronted t he 
challenge of developing reliable solutions for data collection through research and measurement 
for nearly a decade , and the Commission should draw on these important resources in developing 
its approach .8   
In particular, the Commission should leverage the data collection learnings  of other 
agencies, including NTIA, as it develops its measurement framework , as well as coordinate with 
federal agencies more broadly .  For example, i n 2013, the White House tasked NTIA with 
developing a pilot program to monitor real- time spectrum usage.9  As part of that effort, ITS 
developed a test bed in Boulder, Colorado to monitor the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio 
Service (“CBRS”)  band.10  Through these efforts, NTIA has developed knowledge regarding 
implementing and scaling measurement systems.  More generally , ITS has faced the significant 
challenges of spectrum measurement , such as the cost of measurement sensors, the development 
of a s tandard command and control system for heterogenous sensors, and inconsistent metadata

"5 across measurement techniques.11  The Commission should, therefore,  consider coordinating 
with NTIA to determine if its  techniques can be imported when studying non- Fede ral use.  In 
addition, coordination with other federal agencies will ensure that any developed measurement 
approach can not only inform non -Federal spectrum decisions, but also facilitate future 
allocation decisions between  the Commission and NTIA when  Federal and non- Federal users 
share a band.  
II. MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE NEUTRAL TO AVOID OVER-  
OR UNDERVALUING A PARTICULAR SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY.  
To ensure that any measurement approach can “generate accurate and actionable insights 
. . . across different radio services,”12 the Commission’s framework should emphasize neutrality 
and seek measures that provide reliable insights about overall utility.  When considering utility, 
the Commission should measure how much total data is carried by all users of a  particular 
service in a particular spectrum range —and should do so in a way that recognizes differences 
between technologies rather that designing a measurement system with one technology or service 
in mind.   
For example, the NOI  discusses a definition o f “band occupancy” that measures the 
“percentage of frequencies in the band with a detected signal level that exceeds a default or user -
defined threshold” or “the probability that, at a randomly selected moment in time, a radio 
 
11  See id.  Similarly, when conducting measurement simulation s, NIST identified various 
challenges in deploying commercial off -the-shelf sensors, such as the inability of the sensors 
to provide meaningful insight into protection thresholds as well as the sensors being 
overpowered by strong incumbent signals.  See CBRS Sharing Ecosystem As sessment: Test

SPECTRUM & COMMC ’NS TEST NETWORK , at 11 (July 12, 2022)

"6 channel, frequency band or other frequency resource being analyzed will be in use for the 
transmission of information.”13  While a measurement or analytic approach that looks only at 
where a signal is present and not at how much data it carries may be informative for testing compliance with a buildout requirement, it will not offer accurate insights to inform policy decisions about different potential uses of a band.  This is because only measuring the presence of signals without also measuring how much data those signals carry does not allow the Commission to understand how much utility the service produces.  
Furthermore, a  measurement system that relies on received energy at outdoor listening 
points as a proxy for overall band utilization risks undervaluing lower -power, low -activity -
factor, and predominantly indoor operations , such as Wi -Fi, compared to higher -power, high-
activity -factor, outdoor operations, even if those operations create less overall utility for 
consumers than Wi -Fi.  For example, a single high- site, high -power transmitter with a high 
activity factor would produce a large and constant amount of energy at an outdoor measurement 
receiver over a large geographic area, even if it serves only a small number of users across that area.  This same measur ement receiver may not receive as much power per measurement period 
from a large network of low -power, low -activity -factor, indoor Wi- Fi devices serving millions of 
users across the same area —even though the total utility of this large Wi -Fi network would be 
far higher than that of the one high -site transmitter.   An approach that assesses utility by 
measuring received power over small, randomly selected timeframes, and at a limited number of outdoor locations, would therefore produce an unreliable result.   
The measurement system should also seek to provide insights about spectrum reuse.  
High spectrum reuse is key to accommodating more users and more traffic in a geographic area.  
 
13  Id. ¶ 17.",7,NCTA - Non-Federal Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,NCTA – THE INTERNET & TELEVISION ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7 While some frequencies are more amenable to higher reuse than others due to t he different 
wavelengths, some deployment options —such as the use of small cells with lower power levels 
instead of macro cells —also foster higher reuse leading to a more efficient use of the spectrum.    
III. SPECTRUM USAGE MEASUREMENT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN 
COM MISSION DECISION- MAKING , BUT SHOULD NOT BECOM E A TOOL 
FOR DELAYING ACTION.  
Using data to better understand existing spectrum use is critical  for Commission policy 
decisions .  But the Commission should recognize that some parties will attempt to use data 
collections and measurement campaigns to impose long delays, or even effectively stop, 
Commission spectrum proceedings .  NCTA therefore recommends that the Commission 
incorporate into its spectrum usage framework the  key principle that measurement and analys is 
should not become a tool that can be used to substantially delay or block Commission action . 
Time is of the essence for spectrum policymaking decisions.  Long delay s in spectrum 
proceedings  hinder technological progress, economic growth, and the ability to address critical 
societal needs.  It is already difficult for the Commission to keep pace with the speed of 
technological change , and timely spectrum policymaking is critical for the U.S. to  stay 
competitive in the global digital economy.  Therefore, the Commission should engage in new 
data collections or measurement campaigns only whe n doing so is necessary to render a decision.  
And it should establish firm and short timelines for such activities, coincident with its normal rulemaking schedule, to prevent parties from using measurement as a delay tactic.  
IV. AS IT CONSIDERS BROADER CHANGES, THE COMMISSION SHOULD 
MAKE NEAR- TERM IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS EXISTING DATABASES.  
The NOI  recognizes  that both the Commission and spectrum users often lack sufficient 
information about the use of different frequency bands.  This information asymmetry hampers 
effective policymaking and the ability to promote more efficient marketplace behavior.  As it",8,NCTA - Non-Federal Spectrum Usage NOI Comments.pdf,NCTA – THE INTERNET & TELEVISION ASSOCIATION,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 considers mor e fundamental and long- term changes in data gathering mechanisms, the 
Commission also should address limitations in its existing databases—as well as tools provided 
to access th ose data bases —to produce a more immediate effect.  
The Universal Licensing System (“ULS”) is a primary database for spectrum 
management.  ULS allows entities to apply for, modify, renew, and manage their licenses for 
various radio services.  In addition, ULS provides a platform for coordinating frequencies and serves as a data reposit ory for information about licensees, such as their license type, frequency 
bands, geographic locations, and technical parameters.  Accordingly, ULS plays a vital role in spectrum management by supporting transparency, accountability, and effective coordina tion 
among various wireless service providers and users , while also enabling licensees’  buildout and 
substantial -service demonstrations . 
The implementation of ULS at the turn of the century was a n important  step forward in 
spectrum management , as it combin ed multiple disparate databases into a centrally located 
platform and made it possible to electronically file spectrum applications.
14  In fact, a  primary 
goal of ULS was to address information asymmetry .  As the Commission explained, “ ULS will 
enhance the availability of licensing information to the public, which will for the first time have 
access to all publicly available wireless licensing information on -line, including maps depicting a 
licensee’ s geographic service area. ”15  The Commission further stat ed, “The enhanced 
information collection capabilities of ULS will, in turn, enable the Commission staff to easily monitor spectrum use and competitive conditions in the wireless marketplace and will promote

"9 effective implementation of our spectrum manageme nt policies. ”16  The Commission again has 
an opportunity to advance these important policy goals by improving ULS data and data 
accessibility . 
User Interface and APIs.   While the introduction of ULS improved transparency by 
transitioning from paper applications to an online platform, the ULS interface today has become severely outdated.  ULS hosts a trove of useful information, but the cumbersome interface renders much of the data difficult to use .  Therefore , NCTA recommends that the Commission 
develop more modern and user -friendly dashboards and search tools to improve transparency and 
analysis of its existing data.  The development of robust APIs to interface with  ULS and other 
spectrum -related databases wo uld also encourage third  parties to build applications that analyze 
and present spectrum -related data in innovative and novel ways, further improving transparency 
and insight into spectrum usage.
17 
Data  Quality and Availability.  NCTA further recommends that the Commission require 
more frequent updates of the data in ULS and other spectrum databases by licensees so that the information in the databases is both  adequate and accurate.   The Commission should also ensure 
that historical data is more readily available.  Today, it is difficult to analyze historical trends 
from currently available ULS data.  
Additional ULS Fields .
   Furthermore, the Commission should add additional fields to 
ULS filing requirements to support better decision -making and interference analysis .  Additional 
fields should include a more fulsome set of technical parameters for both transmitters and 
receivers.  For instance, for fixed services, the ULS application should request equipment model

"10 numbers and paramet ers, as well as more  detailed information on modulation, antenna patterns, 
transmit power levels and required received power levels, along with usage information.   
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning .  The  NOI recognizes that artificial 
intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) can “offer revolutionary insights into large and 
complex datasets.”18  AI and ML can be powerful tools to mine unstructured data and digest it 
into a more user -friendly format.  For instance, in the International Communications Filing 
System, much of the useful information is found in technical documents attached to satellite call 
signs.  The Commission could use ML to  mine these documents and populate a new structured 
database that is readily searchable and more easily supports broad analysis of a band or service, which would further improv e transparency and insight into spectrum usage. 
More generally, Chairwoman Rosenworcel’s optimism on the transformative capabilities 
of AI and ML tools is well -founded.
19  Howev er, AI models are only as good as the underlying 
data.20  Therefore, the improvements to existing FCC databases described above will allow the 
Commission and the marketplace to better utili ze AI and ML tools to generate reliable 
information . 
CONCLUSION 
As the Commission considers the various approaches to measuring and analyzing 
spectrum use, NCTA recommends that it avoid a one- size- fits-all approach.  Instead, the 
Commission should create a framework to apply when seeking or generating data for a particula r

AT&T Services, Inc., on behalf of itself and its affiliates (collectively, “AT&T”), submits these comments on the above-captioned Notice of Inquiry adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC” or “Commission”) regarding non-federal spectrum use.1  AT&T strongly favors measures to optimize the efficient use of the limited spectrum resources regulated by the FCC.  Because different data collections are needed to support different policy goals, however, AT&T does not believe that it is possible to separate “underlying spectrum policies or service rules” from a “technical inquiry on how to better obtain more sophisticated knowledge of non-Federal spectrum usage.”2  AT&T suggests, therefore, that the Commission articulate, on a case-by-case basis, a specific spectrum efficiency policy goal and allow that goal to drive determinations about the scope and type of data is needed to support that mission.  Indeed, as discussed below, gathering data without a broader policy framework on how the data  1 Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket No. 23-232 (rel.

 2 is to be used is not only potentially burdensome, but also fraught with potential dangers both at a personal privacy level and at a more global spectrum policy level.  I. IF THE COMMISSION’S GOAL IS TO IMPROVE SPECTRUM EFFICIENCY, THE INQUIRY SHOULD START BY IDENTIFYING BANDS THAT LACK INCENTIVES FOR EFFICIENT USE As recognized in the Notice, “[s]pectrum bands do not have uniform service requirements, operational systems, or technical characteristics,” and “[t]here is not a one-size-fits-all approach to measuring spectrum usage.”3  The percentage of time a channel is in use in a specific area is not a measure of spectrum efficiency—passive applications, for example, can be critical for research but never “use” the channel for transmitting.  Whether a system is in use in a particular geographic location is similarly not a measure of spectrum efficiency—spectrum congestion for most bands is not an issue in remote rural areas, but that same spectrum may be woefully capacity constrained in the center of New York City.  Signal strength alone also fails to adequately capture spectrum usage—for some radio applications and deployment scenarios, the use of tall towers and high-power transmitters is less efficient than a distributed network of shorter antenna height operations at a lower power.  Even beyond that, the presence of a signal—channel occupancy—does not measure actual use—as a radio transmitter broadcasting a signal that is not received by any users may create a vast umbra of occupancy with no real use.  The flipside is also true—the absence of emissions spatially does not indicate inefficiency—in point-to-point services, for example, links are densely packed into allocations but, because of the use of highly directional antennas, that usage may not be evident at arbitrary test locations.  3 Notice at 8 (¶ 22) (citing NITRD, Understanding the Spectrum Environment: Data and Monitoring to Improve Spectrum Utilization, NITRD Wireless Spectrum R&D Senior Steering Group Workshop V Report at 13 (2014); accord, NSF Workshop on Spectrum Measurements Infrastructure, Workshop Report at 5 (2016)).",1,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"DRAFT 9/29/23  
 3 Instead, the concept of “Spectrum Efficiency” must be defined by the allocation goals established by the Commission for a band in the first instance.  If the Commission, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, finds that allocating spectrum for a particular use is in the public interest, judging the subsequent “spectrum efficiency” of that band should be undertaken by reference to whether the use of that band is serving the articulated need.  As an example, if the Commission sizes a Public Safety allocation by scaling it to address the communications needs for multi-jurisdictional and multi-responder events like the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers (or mobile networks designed to meet user needs during the busiest hours of the busiest days), the fact that the band is not fully utilized at other times is not an indicator the band is being “inefficiently” used.   Importantly, the Commission should remain mindful that policies and rules for specific allocations create incentives that can promote more efficient use.  For example, Commission’s allocations for mobile broadband services implemented policy decisions that have created compelling economic incentives for licensees to increase the performance of their networks:   • Exclusive licensing frameworks encourage the massive investment in infrastructure required not only for broad coverage, but also for network densification that increases spectral efficiency.  CTIA notes that carriers invested a historic and staggering $39 billion in wireless networks in 2022, with a total industry lifetime investment of $675 billion.4 • The incentive to invest—coupled with regulatory policies allowing flexible use—have meant that mobile broadband carriers have covered 325 million POPs with 5G and driven smartphone penetration to 85%, and, since 2010, lowered wireless plan prices by more than 40%, increased download speeds by 117 times, and supported increases in data traffic from 0.4T MB to 73.7T MB.5   • Exclusivity and flexible use collectively allow mobile carriers to manage interference-limited networks to optimize capacity, which provides incentives to  4 Industry Data, CTIA; available at:  https://www.ctia.org/the-wireless-industry/infographics-library (last visited Sept. 29, 2023). 5 Id.",2,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 4 deploy state-of-the-art networks.  Even with strict FCC technical rules, mobile carriers typically conform to even more rigorous 3GPP standards on things like emissions masks and out-of-band emissions because those technical measures—although expensive—provide greater management and control the interference environment.  Without that exclusivity, and therefore without the ability to control the interference environment, the mobile broadband spectrum allocations would provide far less capacity for U.S. consumers. • Beyond that, mobile broadband spectrum allocations also permit secondary market transactions, including a variety of forms of leasing as well as license sales, geographic partitioning, and spectrum disaggregation.  These policies create incentives—that have worked in practice—for the frictionless transfer of spectrum to those who will put it to the highest valued use.   The need to continually improve has resulted in mobile licensees deploying—within a relatively short span of time—no less than five different generations of mobile technology and increasing spectral efficiency by a factor of 42 since 2010.6  Mobile carriers have also rolled out countless incremental efficiency enhancing measures within each of those generations, such as MIMO, carrier aggregation, antenna beamforming, and supplemental downlinks.   Indeed, the greatest threat to incremental, evolutionary improvements in spectrum efficiency are in bands where similar incentives to develop or upgrade do not exist.  For example, some radio altimeters used in the 4.2-4.4 GHz band had not fundamentally changed in 40 years because there were no inherent incentives for users to keep pace with technology, much less stimulate innovation or proactively react to a changing radio environment.  As a result of the poor performance of some altimeters, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) raised coexistence concerns that delayed implementation of 5G in a band far removed from that spectrum. These FAA concerns were only resolved when radio altimeter technology was upgraded.  But even now, as the aviation industry is developing a new standard for radio altimeters that may have international impacts for spectrum utilization below and above the 4.2- 6 Id.",3,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 5 4.4 GHz band, the fundamental incentives of the aviation industry remain unaltered—even once new standards are in place, there will be no motivation to continue to evolve toward technology that enables more efficient use of spectrum resources absent intervention from U.S. and other international agencies responsible for spectrum management. Although beyond the scope of this inquiry, federal allocations—both shared and exclusive—also raise the specter of inefficient use.  Federal agencies may in circumstances have incentives to improve efficiency for performance reasons, but obviously any lack commercial incentives to improve spectrum usage.  The implications for spectrum efficiency and the potential of warehousing of this national, valuable resource should be the start of the conversation of what bands the Commission should target for further examination, a discussion that will by necessity involve NTIA. As a final matter, the Commission should also examine bands that are explicitly designated as experiments or that involve new access mechanisms, such as the Citizen’s Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) Spectrum Access System (“SAS”).  If the Commission trials a new process for mediating access to spectrum, as it did with the CBRS SAS, periodic reexamination of the mechanisms should be prioritized—especially if that model is being advocated as an access mechanism in other bands.  To the extent that new access systems—whether SASs, automated frequency coordination (“AFC”) databases, or shared access license-lite regimes may represent potential future directions in spectrum policy, a thorough, complete, and peer reviewed review of initial implementations should be undertaken.  And, AT&T further notes that efficiency concerns are heightened in bands that lack any means to transfer rights, such as an efficient secondary rights market, and bands where spectrum warehousing concerns exist.",4,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 6 II. WHAT DATA IS COLLECTED—AND HOW IT IS COLLECTED—SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY SPECIFIC, ARTICULATED POLICY GOALS Although AT&T fully supports the goal of more efficient use of the national spectrum resources, what that means and how to achieve that goal is contextual.  Given the complexity and range of use cases and mechanisms to assign rights across the electromagnetic range that the Commission oversees, the means to achieve those policy goals across different bands is different and highly band-dependent.  In some cases, existing data resources may be sufficient to evaluate and resolve spectrum use concerns.  In other cases, existing data may be insufficient and the Commission could decide to engage in new data collection to target specific policy concerns.  What data is collected, however, should be determined based on the specifics of the both the policy goals under examination and specific (rules and use cases) of the band.  And, although AI and ML solutions may apply at some stage, other more traditional data collection and analysis practices may also make sense and/or be more efficient.  AT&T suggests adopting a framework for how the Commission will approach analytical spectrum use analyses once the Commission determines, as suggested above, that spectrum usage concerns may exist with a defined band.  Having identified a band for evaluation, the Commission should first consider whether the band is serving the needs for which it was allocated—which should drive the specific types of data needed for such an evaluation.  Not all such evaluations need—at the outset—extensive data collection efforts: • Consider, for example, the length of time that was required to determine the status of earth stations in the 3.7 GHz band—and the data validation process involved in that band was merely having users certify they continued to use their facilities. • Similarly, the Commission had no real mechanism to assess the types of radio altimeter equipment deployed in the 4.2-4.4 GHz band. In certain situations, the Commission might determine that it should move beyond an understanding of who is actually using a band to consider whether occupancy (and potentially",5,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"DRAFT 9/29/23  
 7 use) of the band are in line with Commission expectations under current allocations.  This may be particularly important where experimental or new models of spectrum access are implemented and/or where spectrum rights do not generate incentive for intensive spectrum use.  In bands where those market forces ensuring efficiency do not exist, gathering data to determine whether licensees are meeting the goals underpinning an allocation must be a tailored data inquiry specifically tied to the characteristics of the allocation in question.  For some classes of licensees, spectral occupancy may be irrelevant—that Public Safety spectrum is not used some substantial portion of time is irrelevant if that capacity is scaled for disaster events that occur extremely infrequently.  This example also highlights that the Commission should be vigilant to guard against the potential for misuse of data at a policy level.  While understanding the “efficiency” of Public Safety radio use might be instructive as to whether those licensees are fulfilling the goals of a particular Public Safety allocation, the relatively low spectrum occupancy could—but should not be—misused to represent the service as a whole as inefficient.  For other classes of licensees, however, simple spectrum occupancy measurements (e.g., publicly ascertainable spectrum analyzer readings) may be able to determine whether licensees’ representations regarding provision of service are correct. As the Commission considers whether to undertake new, more extensive data collections, it must also recognize and adequately address customer privacy concerns as data regarding spectrum usage inherently raises privacy concerns.  For example, neither the FCC, nor the NTIA, has released the CBRS usage data underlying the CBRS Report, despite that data has been collected on an aggregated basis with anonymization protocols.7  The FCC’s Notice further notes  7 An Analysis of Aggregate CBRS SAS Data from April 2021 to January 2023, NTIA Technical Report TR-23-567 (May 2023).",6,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 8 that AFCs do not collect spectrum use data—AT&T had argued that AFCs should collect and retain transmission records for the purpose of facilitating resolution of interference complaints, but unlicensed device manufacturers argued that even mere registration posed a privacy risk.8  To the extent that the FCC begins to collect spectrum usage data for specific bands, it should remain consistent with its prior data practices, articulate a policy that recognizes different layers of privacy interests, adequately protect those interests, provide specific goals for the collection of data, and—in the context of the rulemaking—develops rules that collect only appropriate data. III. THE USE OF ML AND AI MUST BE EVALUATED IN CONTEXT The Notice broadly speculates that machine learning (“ML”) and artificial intelligence (“AI”) could improve spectrum efficiency, although the Notice does not propose any specific ML/AI programs for evaluation.9  As discussed below, AT&T believes that the use of ML/AI should be undertaken cautiously—with implementation only in controlled environments where the responsible party has a direct relationship with users involved in the data evaluation. In such regards, ML/AI algorithms are already in use today within carriers’ network platforms.  This use is appropriate because it is tightly controlled—when carriers use their own data to optimize spectrum use, they have appropriate security controls in place to ensure restricted access to customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”); incentives, as the entity with the customer relationship, to protect and safeguard CPNI and strictly limit proliferation of data consumers deem sensitive; a history of structural protection of CPNI that does not exist anywhere else; and, incentives to utilize the data to improve their customers’ experience.  8 Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 3852, 3882 (¶ 81) (2020). 9 Notice at 1 (¶ 1).",7,2023-10-03 ATT Spectrum Use-FINAL.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 9 As an example, Nokia has cited to the following AI/ML solutions that exist in carrier networks today:10 • Enhancements in the devices and network for more efficient radio transmission and radio resource management. Ongoing work in 3GPP reports significant gains of up to 30% for cell edge throughput and other significant KPIs. • AI/ML baseband solutions which outperform conventional approaches already today by up to 3 dB in terms of receiver performance with throughput gains of 30%. • Decreased power consumption and improved energy efficiency of network nodes and devices. • Improved end-user perception for high-demand applications like AR/XR by reducing latency and network link failures. • Full end-to-end automation of network management, including faster and more accurate predictions and reactions to network conditions and faults. AI and ML are also used to monitor and detect fraudulent activity and prevent cyber-attacks. The FCC should not, however, expand use of ML and AI use beyond implementations controlled by a licensee that impact only their own use, which raises a host of serious concerns.  There are countless stories of ML and AI systems that have been “trained” with data sets that seem to perform well, but in reality produce flawed results.11  The dangers of implementing ML- or AI-based systems also include ensuring the validity of the results—so a precursor must first be  10 AI/ML unleashes the full potential of 5G-Advanced, Nokia (dated Jan. 26, 2023); available at:  https://www.nokia.com/blog/aiml-unleashes-the-full-potential-of-5g-advanced/ (last visited Sept. 29, 2023). 11 Hundreds of AI tools have been built to catch covid.

CONCLUSION AT&T supports measures to achieve the fullest practical utilization of radio spectrum.  But overarching exercises to gather data without recognizing the myriad differences in utilization from band-to-band may ultimately distract from that mission.

COMMENTS OF WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES  
 WISPA  – Broadband Without Boundaries  hereby comments on certain aspects of the 
Notice of Inquiry (“ NOI”) in the above- captioned proceeding.
1  
Introduction 
 WISPA is a trade organization that represents the interests of hundreds of small and 
medium- sized  fixed wireless internet service  providers that deliver broadband internet 
connectivity services to approximately nine million consumers, businesses and industrial users, first responders and community institutions, often in areas of the country where other providers have declined to invest.  To provide their services, fixed wireless providers frequently use unlicensed, shared  and exclusive- use licensed spectrum at low -band, mid -band and high-band 
frequencies, predominantly in rural, unserved, and underserved areas.  In many rural and remote areas, these providers offer the only terrestrial source of fixed broadband access.  In areas with other broadband options, they  provide a community- based  alternative that benefits customers by 
fostering competition, thereby lowering costs and improving the quality of broadband services.

  For more than twenty years, smaller providers such as WISPA’s members have deployed 
affordable and reliable broadband service with innovative and e volving fixed wireless 
technology, a combination of spectrum bands, and their own capital to meet the needs of 
consumers, businesses, health care facilities, governmental entities, and first responders in rural areas that have not historically been cost -efficient for larger companies to deploy wireline plant.  
By providing broadband services with their own capital, they also have created thousands of jobs in rural and exurban areas that, in turn, attract additional businesses and investment.  They have continually upgraded their networks with new technology and when available, new spectrum 
allocations to meet consumer demand and have successfully responded to the dramatic rise in bandwidth consumption during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

 As the Comm ission is aware,  WISPA ha s actively participated in nearly every spectrum 
proceeding before the Commission, and continues to do so today.  Its policy priorities have centered on the following tenets:  
• Ensuring a balanced spectrum allocation approach that ma kes spectrum available on a 
licensed, unlicensed , and shared approach, with an increasing emphasis on shared 
spectrum managed by databases  or dynamic spectrum coordination system s to ensure 
incumbents are protected from harmful interference.  
 
• Where licenses are exclusively licensed  via auction , making spectrum available in 
smaller geographic lots and smaller spectrum segments to provide meaningful 
opportunities for smaller companies to acquire spectrum.  
• Fostering opportunistic use  when and where spe ctrum is not being used.

 For WISPA’s members, s pectrum is a precious resource that must be used efficiently  to 
maximize consumer benefits .  Current spectrum allocation policies and buildout rules often do 
not adequately  consider the extent of spectrum usage, instead allowing spectrum to be 
warehoused  or lie fallow .  A study of spectrum utilization can therefore provide valuable insights 
into how and where spectrum can be more efficiently utilized and how and where more s pectrum 
can be made available to users where it is currently underutilized.  This is not, however, a simple 
matter of monitoring for a specific signal level.  Different use cases, different radio access technologies, different licensing practices and diffe rent frequency ranges all militate towards 
having a range of different policies for measuring use of and allocating spectrum. 
Discussion  
Defining Spectrum Usage  
WISPA supports the Commission’s interest in defining spectrum usage.
4  Although the 
ITU and NI ST definitions of  spectrum  occupancy are technically valid,5 they do not on their own 
provide the necessary guidance for policy across all bands.  In some cases, it may be more useful to define two different levels of frequency utilization, one of “occupi ed,” in which there is some 
usage,  and one of “fully occupied,”  in which overall utilization  – in terms of both geography and 
bandwidth – is at a level where additional usage would be significantly detrimental to existing users .  These two  terms  could be the same in the historically common use cases of services that 
could only support one user at a time on a given frequency range  at a given location , versus  
services that tolerate real -time sharing.  In studying the occupancy of various spectrum ba nds, 
WISPA urges the Commission to differentiate between bands that are “occupied” and may be

5 Id. at 6 ( ¶ 17).",2,WISPA Spectrum NOI Comments.pdf,WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 
 able to tolerate additional users, and those that are “fully occupied” and cannot accommodate 
additional users. 
With respect to each of these definitions, usage s hould be considered in terms of 
geography, frequency, and time.6  Such consideration will lead to policies that expand 
opportunities for spectrum sharing across all dimensions.  For frequency usage, the Commission 
should look to current allocations and consider the extent to which the band is being used.  For 
example, it may be that a user is occupying only a portion of the band, whether licensed or 
unlicensed, suggesting a policy permitting opportunistic use.  Notably, the Commission has 
adopted this poli cy for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service  (“CBRS”)  and the 6 GHz band, 
and is considering a similar model for the 12.2 -12.7 GHz band.  In other cases, it may be 
possible to clear the band to allow for exclusive use licenses and/or a combination of differ ent 
allocation models.  For geographic usage, the Commission should consider areas that are small 
enough to assess whether the band is “occupied” or “fully occupied.”  In so doing, the 
Commission would consider areas that may be smaller than an exclusively licensed area, such as 
a Partial Economic Area, which would tend to show more spectrum occupancy in densely 
populated urban areas and less usage in sparsely populated rural areas.  Examining occupancy at 
a granular level might well lead to spectrum alloca tion policies and deployment rules that better 
discourage spectrum warehousing in less populated – and less profitable – rural areas.  As with 
frequency usage, areas that lack intensive spectrum usage may be ripe for opportunistic use.  For 
time usage, the re may be certain time periods  whe n a user does not use spectrum, which could 
free up spectrum for others.  As an example, utilities and internet -of-things (“ IoT”) companies 
 
6 Id. at 6 ( ¶ 18).",3,WISPA Spectrum NOI Comments.pdf,WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"5 
 could share spectrum with other users and collect data from devices at times when there is low 
spectrum occupancy.   
As these considerations and examples demonstrate, “other RF metrics beyond the mere 
presence of a signal at a particular strength could shed light on spectrum usage.”7  WISPA agrees 
that, for each of geography, frequency and time,  these metrics should include “(1) throughput; 
(2) population actually or potentially served; and (3) the number or density of end- user devices 
or access points.”8    
Band- Specific Considerations  
As its positions in various spectrum band allocations and operating rules over the years 
makes clear, WISPA agrees that “[t]here is not a one- size- fits-all approach to measuring 
spectrum usage.”9  Different licensing policies yield  different results.  For example, Part 101 
Fixed Service licenses are coordinated  on a path basis , such that they receive a channel with no 
other use that would conflict with desired signals.  This coordination takes into account the antenna patterns of both ends of the link, while antenna performance standards ensure that little signal emanates far from the boresight  of any licensed transmitter .  Signals on the same 
frequency in the same area may thus overlap provided that their antenna selectivity prevents conflict.  A frequency should only be deemed occupied, then, in such cases, with regard to a specific receive antenna placement and orientation.   Avoidance of conflict involves coordination 
within a “keyhole” area, so called because of its shape, which extends a greater distance in the boresight direction and to a much smaller distance in other directions.

"6 
 Mobile services are licensed under the opposite approach .  A given frequency range in a 
geographic area is exclusively licensed to a single party.  This is considered important for 
mobility because it permits  the licensee to place base station antennas  wherever practical and 
useful to achieve desired coverage, and omnidirectional antennas in user equipment such as mobile handsets only pick up a single licensee’s signals.  There may be signals from more than one of that licensee’s base stations, but technical  features  under the licensee’s control may 
minimize the impact of such conflict.  
But while the policy for mobile operation is to grant geographic exclusivity, the use of a 
channel within a licen see’s band in its licensed area may constitute occupancy  but does not 
constitute full occupancy .  Nor does a percentage of population served or density of devices 
determine full occupancy .  License areas are a legal construct but occupancy should be 
determined based upon the technical construct of actual coverage range.  That is, a cell with a 5 -
mile range does create usage within a 5 -mile area, but does not have any bearing on the actual 
occupancy of the channel 50 miles away even if they are in the same exclusively  licensed area 
(PEA, MEA, CMA, etc.).   
It is thus vital to take urban, suburban, and rural areas into account when evaluating 
usage.  Clearly , spectrum usage is going to be greater in urban areas, while large geographic area 
exclusive licensing in many servic es results in spectrum going unused in rural areas where 
mobile carriers simply do not need it.  It is not likely that any one area can serve as a proxy for all similar areas, but a sampling methodology is likely to be useful in cases where actual measurem ents or detailed studies are required.  
Fixed services have been able to make intensive use of their frequencies by means of 
precise coordination of individual paths.  This is obviously not practical in mobile applications.",5,WISPA Spectrum NOI Comments.pdf,WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7 
 A mobile frequency is reasonably deemed occupied at a location when it is capable of providing 
service; that is, when user equipment at that location is within useful range of a base station. Mobile occupancy, then, is a function of base station coverage.  A third category of use, fixed point -to-multipoint, has utilization characteristics in between the two.  Like a mobile service, it is 
usually provided via sectorized antennas that provide ser vice to numerous sites across an area. 
But fixed client devices, unlike mobile devices, can make use of directional antennas to select from more than one base station on the same channel.  Thus , a frequency may be occupied in one 
direction but not in another. Such client devices are, under Part 15 rules, typically categorized as point -to-point devices even though the base station is point -to-multipoint.  This categorization is 
useful for considering occupancy as well.  
At millimeter wave frequencies, and in creasingly often at microwave frequencies, sector 
antennas are becoming beam -forming antennas, wherein the signals they put out are focused at 
some su bset of the sector that they are nominally serving.  This increases the ability to serve 
more users and ag ain broaden the distinction between occupancy and full occupancy.  
The Commission asks whether unlicensed use should be considered.
10  Any measurement 
of spectrum utilization must take unlicensed use into account.  The majority of unlicensed use, of course , is very short range, including wireless LANs and cordless devices , and is extensively 
used.  Wi -Fi is now the most commonly  used medium for  the last hop of most mass -market 
broadband Internet access arrangements .  Many devices, including cell phones, mos t tablets, and 
some laptop computers, do not even have provisions for wired access.  In many areas the 2.4 
GHz unlicensed band, while theoretically an underlay to an ISM band, is utilized as intensively 
 
10 Id.",6,WISPA Spectrum NOI Comments.pdf,WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 
 as any part of the radio spectrum.  The 5 GHz band is  also widely used for Wi -Fi, though with 
more spectrum to begin with, it is likely to see less traffic per megahertz in most areas.  
Unlicensed outdoor and longer -range use is also valuable.  WISPA’s membership 
primarily makes use of unlicensed frequencies  to provide high- speed broadband access service to 
its customers.  Using directional antennas, fixed wireless access providers  are able to achieve 
useful ranges of several miles on the 5 GHz band, provided that line -of-sight is available.  Non -
line-of-sight paths are often achieved on the 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz unlicensed bands, though 
higher noise levels from other types of users largely limit their use to sparsely populated areas.  
The unlicensed 60 GHz band is also growing in popularity, though typically for  shorter -range 
applications. 
Data Considerations  
Certainly , any spectrum utilization study needs to be driven by data.  The Commission 
already collects data from many parties for many purposes, and some of these data collections 
have already become burdensome.  Thus , any new data collection from spectrum users or other 
parties needs to be balanced against the effort needed to provide and collect the data.  A mandatory data collection from unlicensed users of any kind would be an example of an 
unnecessary intrusion and expense.  
The Commission seeks comment on what data it currently lacks.
11  The one obvious data 
type that is  not being collected and which may prove useful is the set of exclusively licensed 
base stations operated by mobile  operators.  Their geographic licenses do not require site -based  
licensing and they generally maintain secrecy on their transmitter location data, though 
transmitters can be individually seen and monitored.  The Commission’s Universal Licensing 
 
11 Id. at 9 ( ¶ 26).",7,WISPA Spectrum NOI Comments.pdf,WISPA – WIRELESS WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 
 System (“ULS”) does not require the information necessary for the Commission to assess 
spectrum use.12  Carriers using exclusively  held  licensed bands s hould be required to submit 
sufficient information to estimate coverage, including location, elevation, transmitter power, antenna beam or sector width, and frequencies utilized.  This is similar to what all CBRS users , 
including G eneral A uthorized A ccess  users that  do not receive protection, must supply to the 
Spectrum Access System  which is not public but which can be used to provide “heat maps .”  The 
Commission need not make all such data public (i.e., entered in ULS), but it could use this information t o determine where service is and is not being provided on any given licensed band.  
WISPA does not believe that crowdsourcing can offer sufficient accuracy and data 
uniformity, much less granularity, necessary to yield helpful results.
13  Crowdsourcing depends 
upon having very large numbers of members of the public submitting information that is, on 
average, usefully accurate.   It can never be precise, as the general public does not have well -
calibrated gear and is submitting information from loosely defined locations.  Its one obvious 
value is in determining whether or not a mobile carrier has coverage at a given location.  The  
quality of coverage is not well characterized and even a limited number of positive reports of what turn out to be marginal signals may give an impression of better coverage than exists for most users.  Also problematic,  a lack of crowd -sourced reports wi ll rarely be usable to 
distinguish between a lack of coverage or simply a lack of reporters passing through an area, especially a remote one in a rural area or a lesser -used back road.  WISPA  therefore do es not 
recommend that crowdsourcing be a primary too l, though it may be occasionally useful for 
identifying areas for further study.

 Next Steps  
 For next steps,14 the Commission could conduct a pilot program to study occupancy in a 
small number of bands with different characteristics, such as an exclusively  licensed band, a Part 
101 point- to-point band and a band in which multiple use cases are present.15  These bands 
should be reviewed to determine whether and to what extent they are “occupied” or “fully 
occupied,” taking into account geography, frequency and time and the particular licensing structure.  As noted above, small urban and rural geographic areas should be studied, not larger exclusively licensed areas.  As part of the pilot program, the Commission may also want to experiment with different techniques for measuring spectrum use.
16   
 Until the Commission and the public have developed viable spectrum occupancy measurement techniques through the pilot program, it would be premature for the Commission to establish a Policy Statement or provide recomm endations on best practices.

Conclusion 
 WISPA appreciates the Commission’s interest in understanding spectrum usage to inform spectrum allocation policies and deployment rules.

COMMENTS  
OF THE  
ENTERPRISE WIRELESS ALLIANCE  
 
The Enterpr ise Wireless Alliance ( “EWA ”) is ple ased to file Comments in response to 
the Federal Communications Commission ( “FCC”) Notice of Inquiry into non- Federal 
spectrum usage.1  Wirel ess communications  is foundational  to American  life in the 21st 
century , and wireless service depends on spectrum , whether licensed or unlicensed, shared or 
exclusive , private or commercial .  Because spectrum is a limited resource, the issue s raised  in 
the NOI are intended to as sist the FCC in identifying “ new opportunities to facilitate  more 
efficient  spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable 
co-existence among users and services.”2  Its objective is to maximize the efficient use of 
spectr um.3 
EWA shares that goal.  As discussed below, its members , a broad va riety of utilities , 
transportation, industrial , manufacturing, and other enterprise entities , make intensive use of 
limited amounts of spectrum to address the ir internal operating requi rements .  This spectrum is 
used in mines, shipyards, airports, forests, factories , farms, refineries, power generation and 
distribution facilities , and in other industrial activities that sup port the United States economy.

 EWA  and i ts members  are prepared to assist the FCC in its  effort to  quantify spectrum 
utilization and thereby identify opportunities for more intensive use .  However, as noted in the 
NOI, there is no one -size-fits-all in calculating spectrum utilization .  The  NOI r ecognizes that 
the metric s used  to assess utilization by public safety organizations and utilities , for example,  
must be different than those applied to other spectrum users  and bands.  EWA agrees , but as 
discussed below , submits that th e more funda mental distinction  is between  licensed spectru m 
used f or private internal systems generally and  that used in  the provision of commercial 
service.   
Commercial wireless networks meet the communications needs  of consumer s and 
certain internal business requirements.  Virtually every worker in the nation has a cellphone 
and likely uses it for some business a s well as personal purposes.  It may be app ropriate to 
focus on factors such as throughput, servable populat ion, density of end- user devices and/or the 
capacity of the system to accommodate dense usage when evaluating spectrum utilization on 
comme rcial networks.4  But public safet y, utility,  and myriad other business enterprise entities  
also invest in th e depl oyment  and maintenance of private, internal syst ems designed and built 
to their specifications and operated under thei r exclusive control. They make these investments 
for sec urity, reliability, privacy, employee safety , operational eff ectiveness , competitive goals , 
and othe r critical objectiv es. 
The gre at majority of t hese system s utilize site - and frequency -specific spectrum 
licensed unde r Parts 90 and 101 of the FCC rul es.5  These are nar rowband, non- conti guous 
frequencies with very limited bandwidth.  B y FCC rule in some instances and in respons e to

 capacity requirements in other s, many of these syste ms have already  migrated  from analog to 
more efficient digital technology.  This spectrum, by any definition, is inte nsively used. 
FCC -certifi ed Frequen cy Advisor y Committees ( “FACs ”) such as EWA coordinate 
these systems based on FCC rules that  provide for  interference- free, co-channel and adjacent  
channel operations within a defined area . They effectively act as “ spectrum shari ng 
administrator s.”  Once c oordinated applications are granted by the FCC , licensees then must 
invest in  equipment to d eploy on each frequency at each licensed location .  They must certify 
that the frequency(s) h as been placed into operation within one year and must certif y continue d 
operatio n at each ten -year license renewal.6  Thus, unlike  systems authorized  for broad sw athes 
of spectr um over large geographic area s, these pr ivate internal systems are held accountable for 
each frequency and site authorized .  Their license data is captured in the Universal Licensing 
System ( “ULS ”),7 which, when functioning, offers as det ailed a descripti on of utilization of 
this spectrum as any alternative system could provide .8  
Each of these s ystems represents a n internal communications r equirement  identifie d by 
the licensee.  In some instances, such as a truckin g fleet  or school bus op eration , spectrum  may 
be in essentially continuous use during working hours , but largely quiet at night.  S ystems used 
in indus trial facilitie s such as min es, refine ries, and manufacturing plants  may be in use 24/7, 
but typically are designed to direct signals within the facility  to overcome intrinsically hostile 
environments with walls , large machinery,  and othe r obstructions.  M onitoring at any distance 
might sugges t that the  spectrum was not in use  and could be reassigned to another licensee, but 
 
6 Public safety licensees are exempt from the ten-year renewal certification obligation.  
7 For site - and frequ ency -specific systems,  ULS is not a stat ic “snapshot -in-time” database.  Thes e systems are 
modi fied routinely as fre quenc ies and/or sites are adde d and del eted, as t he number of units in the systems 
changes, and as technical parameters s uch as t ransmitter power an d antenna heigh t are modified.   
8 Like any databa se, ULS is only as accurate as the data entered .  EWA bel ieves returning t o five-year license 
terms would improve the accuracy of ULS data.  It also believes FACs could play a  useful suppor tive role in 
helping the FCC  identify systems wh ere service has been disconti nued permanently and those wh ose license 
parameters are not fully consistent with their actual operations.",2,EWA Comments re Spectrum Usage NOI - WT 23-232   10-3-23.pdf,The Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”),Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 the result would be int erference into a n already ha zardous environment.  In all systems, c ertain  
frequencies may be d esign ated for eme rgency use only a nd remain quiet until such an e vent, 
but the  need for immediate , unrestricted  access to the frequency is critic al at that time.  
Monitoring, if the FCC were to use that metric, on the sca le needed to qua ntify private inte rnal 
spectrum use is impractical for many reas ons given the number and variety of such systems 
nationwide  and not likely to yield reliable data.  
This use of spectrum  in a private sys tem is unlike a consumer -oriented commercial 
network in several ways.  As noted above, private sy stem licensees are acco untable for each 
frequency at each  site under  a licensing regime that allows the FCC or third parties to know 
where the spectrum is authorized  for use.  If a frequency is not assigned to a licensee in a 
particular area,  or is only authorized for  shared use , it is immediately available for assignment 
to another applicant through the frequency coordination process.  By contrast, c ommercial 
networks typically have geographic authorizations  and are not require d to identi fy which  sites 
or frequencies  are in ser vice in a given a rea beyond the build- out showings required to satisfy 
overall population or  geographic coverage.  Additionally , spectrum used in s ystems designed  
for personal and business use by the general  consumer population is like ly to carry  traffic 2 4/7, 
though that spectrum  is also actively modif ied for usage patterns and capacity  that suits  those 
consumers ’ needs , such as afterhours when gamers and TikTok watchers are involved .  By 
contrast, frequencies in private system s may have  periods of limited a ctivity , but must be 
available for immediate access when an emergency or operational  need arises .   
Thus, while geographic , time, and frequ ency usage a nalyses would not yield useful  
measurement s of private wireless spectrum utilization  for the reasons describe d above, those 
metric s may be appropriate  for commercial networ ks that focus  on population density to satisf y 
the FCC ’s build- out requirements .",3,EWA Comments re Spectrum Usage NOI - WT 23-232   10-3-23.pdf,The Enterprise Wireless Alliance (“EWA”),Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Private internal and commercial systems each ser ve an important but d istinct need.   
Their use of spe ctrum is not comparable , and there is no single metric th at can reasonab ly be 
used to qua ntify both  uses.  EWA submits that utilization of Parts 90 and 101 spectrum in 
systems that support public safety and other private ent erpri se act ivities is demonstrably 
intensive and efficient .  It will continue to keep pace with emerging technologie s within its 
bandwidth limitations and  thereby maximize the efficient use of spectrum  by private entities .

In the Matter of Advancing Understanding of Non -Federal Spectrum Usage  
WT Docket No. 23 -232

We are also members of SpectrumX, the Spectrum Innovation Center funded by the 
National Science Foundation. Our combined research on access to spectrum spans 
multiple decades and covers a wide range of technical, economic, and policy issues. 
These comments  reflect our own views, and should not be interpreted as views 
advocated by SpectrumX or our home institutions.  
 
 
Why Collect Data on Spectrum Usage?  
  
In this NOI, the Commission “explore(s) the exciting potential to advance our 
understanding of non -Federal spectrum usage by leveraging new data sources, 
technologies, and methods. While academics, industry researchers, and regulatory 
bodies have devoted c onsiderable attention to the topic, we have traditionally relied on 
third parties for metrics regarding actual spectrum usage rather than conduct our own 
studies.”  
  
Collection and analysis of data that reflects spectrum utilization often helps regulators 
understand how spectrum is deployed across different applications. To wield such tools 
and to effectively advance their policy goals, the Commission must understand h ow 
monitoring of spectrum can and should take place, exploiting a mix of technically 
sophisticated and functionally subtle strategies. While third party studies can provide 
essential inputs to regulatory decision -making, it is key to see how the task for w hich the",0,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"2 monitoring is designed is part and parcel of the system constructed, the way 
“monitoring” is defined, implemented, and then utilized.  
 
The NOI states that the Notice “represents a technical inquiry on how to better obtain 
more sophisticated knowledge of non -Federal spectrum usage – and how we could take 
advantage of modern capabilities for doing so in a cost -effective, accurate, scalable,  
and actionable manner…”  
  
We recognize that the Commission seeks technical input on what, how, and where in 
the overall space of Time/Location/Frequency (TLF) measurements should be made, 
and in the next section offer our own suggestions on utilization measurements that can 
serve a s useful inputs to policy analysis. However, useful measurement campaigns 
must further overall social welfare objectives. One must consider institutions and trade -
offs, making smart choices.  In particular, it would be harmful to pursue data blindly, as 
irrelevant data generation can waste scarce resources (both in the costs of collection 
and the ensuing costs of trying to utilize the data) and lead to confusion. An 
administrative regime that, for instance, proposes to maximize  the data used in order to 
inform regulatory decision making would inevitably fail to achieve fundamental social 
welfare objectives by imposing large costs in pursuit of information having limited 
practical use. In reality, many data -generation projects wi ll not prove cost -effective, o r 
reasonably scale (to produce social value), or produce no actionable information in 
improving regulatory decisions that advance the public interest.  
 
A general concern is that the NOI suggests that the FCC regards utilization , rather than 
valuation , as a key metric that should drive policy decisions. Utilization can be a useful 
input to policy decisions; however, valuation must be the guiding metric. More 
specifically, the implication throughout the NOI is that the FCC seeks utilization data to 
determine what bands are candidates for reassignments and coexistence with other 
applications. While such reassignments may be warranted, the utilization data can not 
directly and fully inform the reallocations that result.  To the extent that such use rules 
embed rigidities in spectrum access that do not admit to low -cost correction by market 
participants, this result can too easily create persistent inefficiencies . 
 
The classic example of this is the “command and control” allocation of broadcast TV 
spectrum that foreclosed the use of prime spectrum for mobile cellular over a period of 
decades. Rather than assigning flexible use rights to radio spectrum and allowing 
competitive forces to discover an optimal mix of approaches to video delivery, a huge 
swath of bandwidth was allocated to one specific application under rigid rules in the 
1952 TV Allocation Table.  Even while competing technologies (including cable and 
satellite delivered video) emerged as competitively superior, the regulatory lock -in",1,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 blocked deployment of more efficient options over most of the original TV Broadcast 
Allocation for decades.  This was a product of the “one -size-fits-all” regulatory template 
imposed to mandate a particular wireless service.  
 
Unfortunately, Broadcast TV is not an isolated example of how rigidities imposed over 
the past several decades have diminished the value derived from spectrum resources. 
Other examples include the 1999 allocation to dedicate bandwidth for vehicular 
networks at 5.9 GHz, the introduction of TV white spaces, and fixed allocations to 
space -based applications, all of which come with regulatory constraints that limit how 
the spectrum might be repurposed for ot her uses in response to changing technologies, 
demands, and business models. Rather than using utilization data to justify replacing 
one set of rigidities by another – including those associated with particular rules for 
coexistence – a fuller panoply of d ata may instead be used to justify removing rigidities 
in spectrum access that constrain the overall value derived from particular bands.  
 
What Data Might be Helpful?  
  
Here we propose utilization data sets that would be particularly useful in informing policy 
decisions concerning access rights. We then discuss the limitations of utilization data in 
crafting rules for access rights.  
 
CBRS utilization:  We have an ongoing study on evaluating CBRS for sharing spectrum 
in terms of relative success and value generated versus other access methods [1]. We 
believe this type of study is crucial in determining whether or not such coexistence 
schemes are appropri ate for other bands. While data from the PAL auctions and 
deployment of CBSDs from the NTIA can help to infer certain aspects of the value 
created by CBRS in particular locations, it provides very limited (or no) insight into 
several important questions: To what extent is CBRS  spectrum being used (e.g., urban 
versus rural, inland versus coastal) and at what power levels? Where and when are 
PALs used versus GAA channels?  Are channel assignments relatively static, modestly 
dynamic, or highly dynamic? In addition to SAS data (whi ch may or may not be 
available), utilization data for CBRS over a wide geographic area would help to answer 
those and similar questions.  We might thereby advance our analysis in interpreting the 
value supplied by CBRS in the context of alternative access schemes.  
 
Satellite bands:  There is current interest in sharing spectrum allocated to satellite 
services with terrestrial -based systems. Utilization data for the satellite systems can 
help determine where interference may pose coordination problems for coexistence. 
However, the purp ose of collecting such data should not be assumed to imply that rigid 
“one-size-fits-all” rules should be specified, as perhaps TLF regions in which the rival",2,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 systems can operate. Rather rules should be designed to incentivize the interested 
parties to cooperate in collecting useful data and designing interference mitigation 
methods that balance costs and benefits. Those methods have the end goal of 
optimizing s ystem performance, and allow usage patterns that may vary both within and 
across TLF regions.  
 
Other legacy bands:  Spectrum occupancy statistics do not map value generation. 
Moreover, low or under -utilization, if that can be defined, does not generally justify the 
replacement of one set of narrowly defined access rules by another such set. Rather, 
wherever possible th e goal should be to reduce rigidities and introduce flexible use rules 
that rely on market forces to shape the evolution of wireless applications, services, and 
access technologies.  
 
We add that utilization data in cellular and unlicensed bands can help to provide 
answers to questions pertaining to rural versus urban use and coverage, indoor or low -
power versus outdoor or high -power usage, coverage in low - versus high -income areas, 
and adoption of new bands, such as millimeter wave. That can provide insight into how 
new technologies are affecting markets and business models and, importantly, 
impacting disputes over access conflicts that regulators are called on to resolve. 
However, low utilization in TLF regions does not in itself imply a market failure. Where 
utilization appears to be low, but operators or users have the freedom to expand 
wireless use, the observed market may exhibit optimizations that include the relevant 
cost-benefit tradeoffs, as well as competitive pressures across bands.  
 
Utilization versus Value  
  
“Intense” observed utilization of a particular band does not, alternatively, imply high 
value. This underscores paragraph 22 in the NOI: measured activity across bands 
allocated to radar, satellites, mobile cellular, and geolocation can reflect a wide range of 
values.  The s ocial gain must also account for alternative uses of the spectrum 
(opportunity cost) as well as the cost of providing the associated service by other means 
(for example, moving to another band or via wired links if possible). Spectrum analysis 
of various b ands must therefore be interpreted with an understanding of economics, 
transaction costs, and opportunity costs.  These underscore the importance of the FCC 
looking to understand the cost-effective, scalable  and actionable  factors associated with 
data collection endeavors.  
 
In general, the value of a resource or commodity can be revealed if it is freely utilized 
and traded. The marginal value is then revealed in the price. In the case of flexible use 
liberal licenses for spectrum access marginal values are revealed by auction  prices,",3,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"5 which can be used to directly compare the value of spectrum across different locations 
(e.g., urban versus rural) and bands (midband versus millimeter wave). Estimating value 
becomes a more subtle, less transparent exercise when allocations are rigid, for 
example, spectrum allocated to legacy applications (e.g., broadcast TV, satellite), 
unlicensed use where the access price is set to zero by the regulator, and shared 
access with a designated incumbent.  
 
The NOI (Par. 22) makes the important point that “[S]everal bands may exhibit 
infrequent usage that are [sic] nonetheless mission critical for their intended uses.”  This 
truth underscores how raw technical measurement of spectrum occupancy do not 
reveal t he tradeoffs required in the balancing cited. The insight is that valuation is not 
perfectly correlated with occupancy, by given technical measures, and may not (in some 
circumstances) even be positively correlated.1 
 
An example is shown in the plots made via spectrum analyzers: cellular bands appear 
moderately utilized while broadcasting bands (FM and TV) appear the most intensely 
used frequencies.  (See, e.g., Figure 1.) The result is perverse in economic terms, if 
these terms are misinterpreted to have something important to do with social 
productivity.  In fact, TV broadcast signals have available substitutes (namely, cable, 
satellite, and broadband Internet) that have made off -air broadcast reception a very low -
valued video delivery service.  At the same time, the “busy” TV channels observed have 
relatively high opportunity costs, given demands for additional bandwidth in 5G and 
other competing technologies.  The most “occupied” frequencies in technical 
measurements turn out to yield evidence of emissions but not of economic value, and 
yet have blocked potentially more valuable uses over long periods.  
 
1 Indeed, factors like latency or availability can be more important for some applications than utilization.  
In some cases, addressing these factors might lead to a reduction in utilization, where the trade -offs may 
vary with the technology being used.",4,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Figure 1.  General RF Band Survey, Shared Spectrum (Sept. 23, 2010).  
 
This type of technical analysis has often led interested industry groups to sponsor 
studies that purportedly support policy conclusions that would favor a target application. 
This is illustrated in the bar graph below, taken from [3].  The bars correspond to 
different studies that estimate the value of unlicensed bands, liberally licensed 
frequencies, and broadcast TV spectrum. The graph shows that the value of spectrum 
allocated to Broadcast TV, as estimated in a study by a broadcast industry association, 
is significantly higher than the value of spectrum that supports other services. It is only 
through a proper accounting of the costs and benefits of using spectrum as input to 
support the particular application that reveals the flaws in those studies. Simi lar 
mistakes have been made in FCC cost -benefit studies [3, 4].",5,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Figure 2.  “Valuation” Studies Asserted to Identify Spectrum Values  
(Annual Gains in $B)  
 
The Commission asks (Par. 22), “How should unlicensed use be factored in, if at all? 
…[unlicensed users] in almost all cases, operate as an underlay to licensed or 
industrial, scientific, and medical equipment (ISM) use.”  This latter comment is dubious, 
given that several bands are allocated primarily for unlicensed access, including recent 
additions in 5.9 GHz and 6 GHz. (We are aware that there are other users of these 
bands such as fixed wireless, but it is expected that unlicensed service will be the 
dominant use of the bands.) The issue in any contentious allocation, which must include 
a choice between mutually exclusive alternatives, is how the optimal selection is made.  
Because the FCC does not possess the information as to which ultimate distributi on of 
services will achieve the highest social gain, it operates on non -economic criteria that 
are vague, judgmental, and political.  Competing interests attempt to advance 
compelling arguments, but do not reveal their actual valuations – no penalty is 
registered for overstating the social value associated with the spectrum allocation most",6,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 desired by their firm or organization.  Even when the FCC attempts to discern the merit 
of these cost -benefit arguments, it has produced disappointing results [4].  
 
 
Incentives to Misreport Measurements  
 
The Commission makes the point that as an agency, it does not supply services or 
directly implements monitoring – it must rely on third parties. Hence, spectrum 
“monitoring” that is technically desirable must be nested within the FCC’s own “supply 
chain.”  Here we point out potential problems with relying on third parties that may have 
incentives to misreport measurements, either through selectivity bias, distorted 
calibrations, emphasis on worst - or best -case scenarios, or other means.  
 
Consider the scenario in which the FCC wishes to use measurements to evaluate 
alternative uses of a particular band. In economic terms, the fundamental problem the 
FCC faces is an information asymmetry: the measurements may be manipulated to 
support distor ted estimates of actual valuations that are private information, hidden to 
the FCC. To discourage this rent seeking behavior, the FCC can attempt to verify 
submitted measurements, but at some cost. Depending on the private values held by 
stakeholders and t he verification cost, this can lead to unreliable measurements and 
potentially erroneous conclusions. For example, if the value to a stakeholder is relatively 
low compared with the verification cost (say, known to the stakeholder), then the 
stakeholder sti ll has an incentive to distort the measurements, and those measurements 
provide unreliable input to the FCC.  
 
An alternative is to introduce flexible use rules that incentivize stakeholders to negotiate 
amongst themselves for spectrum access. That would incentivize interested parties to 
make their own measurements that inform them of potential returns on investmen t, 
depending on proposed schemes for interference management. Access schemes, 
including the development of rules for coexistence, can then arise organically, 
incentivizing cooperation among interested parties as in the development of cellular and 
WiFi stan dards. In ongoing work we are constructing an analytical model to provide 
insight into the design of an appropriate mechanism for evaluating measurements, 
building upon prior work in the economics literature on mechanism design with costly 
verification [5] .",7,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 Recommendations  
 
We end these comments by adding some recommendations regarding the collection 
and use of data as inputs to policy decision -making. Data sets should be submitted with 
the following expectations:  
 
● They are transparent, meaning the community involved in spectrum -related 
research has access to the data. That includes not only technical measurement 
data, but also data sets useful for economic analysis.  The data should be posted 
in forms that can be ea sily deciphered by non -FCC analysts.  
 
● They are subject to discussion at FCC public hearings.  
 
● FCC cost -benefit studies that rely on the data sets are transparent and, perhaps, 
refereed by experts in various fields.  
 
● There is a shot clock (time limits for regulators) to decide on petitions filed by 
parties requesting rules/allocations that rely on submitted data sets (see, for 
example, [6]).  
 
In response to the conditional statement (par 22): “if commenters agree that taking a 
band -agnostic approach will not work…”, we emphasize the danger of abandoning more 
generic rules (“band -agnostic”) for more specific ones (imposing “command and control” 
across multiple dimensions).  It is compelling that the premise leads the Commission to 
instantly dive into a raft of definitions for specific types of usage, e.g., “fixed point -to-
point or fixed point -to-multipoint” allocations as distinct from “mobile se rvices.” That 
inherently locks in particular network architectures, forcing years - or decades -long, 
expensive, and uncertain regulatory outcomes in order to loosen restrictions to enable 
innovations.  To be clear, such market demand includes efforts by non -profit firms, 
research organizations, public agencies and other interests, in addition to demand from 
commercial service providers.   
  
We recommend undoing this premise and seeing FCC allocations as opportunities to 
afford providers of all stripes, for -profit and nonprofit, full opportunity to reveal their 
demands for valuable opportunities.  This can and has been achieved in many context s 
in spectrum allocation. The FCC has instituted multiple reforms designed to support 
such policy innovations, including license auctions for flexible use spectrum, overlays, 
PCS, AWS -1, incentive auctions, C -Band satellite relocation payments, relaxation of 
ISM band restrictions against spread spectrum, and shot -clocks for license applications 
[6].",8,FCC NoI response Oct 2023 RB TH MH.pdf,"Randall Berry, Thomas Hazlett and Michael Honig",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"10  
We strongly support the FCC’s quest to find common standards for creating access 
rights.  That is because standard legal forms, as with property rights in general, tend to 
be well -understood and more easily developed.  Customization occurs, but benefits by  
starting from default rules that are widely utilized.  With spectrum this means that the 
regulator should be cognizant of transaction costs related to the productive uses, and 
strive to enable a coherent system that allows incumbents, entrants, innovators  and 
consumers clarity in understanding access rights boundaries. Service deployments can 
then reflect improvements from freedom of contract, without imposed rigidities, based 
on limited foresight by either regulators or entrepreneurs as to how technologie s and 
business models may evolve.  That will help to achieve greater coordination and 
efficiency, on the one side, but supports diversity, competition and innovation on the 
other.

Summary  
The Association of Federal Communications Consulting Engineers ( AFCCE )1 commends  the 
Commission ’s inquiry into steps to better understand usage of Non-Federal radiofrequency 
spectrum. The knowledge attained will advance its management of the spectrum resource and 
benefit current and future users. In these comments we encourage the FCC ’s goal of “effort s to

significant number of members who are registered/licensed professional engineers.  AFCCE has worked together with 
the FCC for over 60 years to prov ide comments, guidance, and recommendations on such topics as matters of rule 
interpretation, technical collaboration, and assessing impact of FCC policy and implementation suggestions.",0,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

physical relocation has limited the FCC’s ability to match spectrum development to a 
commensurate degree.  For FY2023, the FCC requested a budget authority of $390,192,000, 
offsetting regulatory fee collections. This represents an annualized increase of 4.3% from the 
FY2022 level. After expenses for the spectrum auctions program, which has generated more than 
$233 billion for government use, approximately $257,961,000 is left for all other operations.  
The FCC is t asked with multiple responsibilities such as regulating interstate and international 
communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. Earlier this year a Space Bureau 
was established for satellite and space -based communications activity. Th e breadth and depth of 
the FCC’s responsibilities is immense and its importance in guiding and regulating the nation’s 
wireless and wireline communications is also immense. Optimal spectrum policy relies on the 
FCC’s gathering and ongoing analysis of spect rum usage data as described in the NOI.  
 
Band -Specific Technique s 
In order to better understand spectrum usage, the FCC needs to collect data in a variety of ways.  
AFCCE believes that data collection needs vary considerably by band type and usage .  For 
example, fixed point -to-point services are generally well -defined by the parameters required for 
FCC licensing a facility in these bands.  Spectrum usage can be analyzed from the geographic 
routes, bandwidth, power and modulation types in use.  However, time -of-use may require 
collecting information  by survey  from the operators.  
Fixed -to-multipoint services illustrates a different case in which usage can vary dynamically  by 
end-point locations and duty cycle of usage.  Remote monitoring of network usage is a 
cumbersome task, but could be used to verify system information collected by operators.  
A case in point is the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which refers t o the unlicensed 
spectrum in the United States that can be leveraged for private 5G or private LTE networks, 
especially in urban settings. It consists of 150 MHz of valuable spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. 
There is an opportunity for private 5G/LTE networks to acquire some of this spectrum to support",1,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"® 
fixed wireless backhaul for carrier networks, whether it is fully used or not. This may affect 
efficient user by others under General Authorized Access. Study of actual usage would help 
provide important metrics on rate of usage and geographic reach. This research would need a well -
designed field study.  
 
FCC Approach to Developing Studies and Collecting Information  
Given the frequency range, potentially from HF to millimeter -wave and the variety of spectrum 
usage styles, an investigation of usage should begin with scholarly studies to prepare for data 
collection. This undertaking may involve research universities or commercial research firms, and 
depends on first -hand expertise with a band usage, signal propagation , available user hardware and 
more.  
Investigative studies are difficult for the Commission to mount because of the time and resource 
demands on internal staff.  It may take several months or even years to collect and process the 
data.  Hiring expert, objective firms would  even the demands of on FCC staff and allow a 
supervisory role.  
An FCC contract of scientific research and the actual inventory process es by qualified , select ed 
organizations would also allow better planning and tracking of the FCC's e xpenses for th ese tasks.  
This would also allow the FCC to focus on its core mission of regulating interstate and foreign 
commerce in communication by radio, while also ensuring that the usage studies are conducted in 
a timely and cost -effective manner.  
In conclusion, the FCC needs to collect data on spectrum usage in a variety of ways in order to 
better understand how the spectrum is being used. The type of data collection needed will vary 
depending on the band type and usage. The FCC should consider hirin g expert, objective firms to 
conduct the research and data collection, as this would allow the FCC to focus on its core mission 
and ensure that the studies are conducted .",2,AFCCE Commnents -- FCC WT Bureau Comments --Docket 23-232.pdf,ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTING ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

II. DATA CONSIDERATIONS - METHODS FOR DATA COLLECTION 
HII MTC recognizes the challenges of cost and burden, standardization, and technical 
accuracy, on the benefits and drawbacks of various methods to gather robust spectrum data. As 
data robustness refers to the degree to which a dataset can handle variations in collection and 
integration without losing information, statistical validity, or scientific meaning. High-quality 
data is crucial, especially in the context of evolving wireless technologies and spectrum usage to 
advance national spectrum efficiency. 
 Crowdsourcing involves collecting information or input from a large number of people, 
either paid or unpaid. While it can efficiently gather a large amount of data for 
quantitative analysis, it faces challenges like confounding variables and lack of control, 
making it unsuitable for robust qualitative analysis. The setup and maintenance costs are 
high, making it less feasible compared to other approaches. 
 Utilizing external sources such as wireless carriers and third-party data collection 
companies offers a quick method to obtain high-quality data. However, costs, proprietary 
data issues, and negotiations with these sources pose challenges. Engaging in discussions",2,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 
 with commercial entities such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile is highly recommended 
prior to assessing cost-effectiveness. 
 Data collection through modeling may not be reliable, as models based on theoretical 
values lack accountability of real-world factors. Models relying on direct observation 
data require continuous data collection for accuracy. Maintaining a model would entail 
high costs and workforce requirements, making it less favorable compared to direct 
observation. 
 HII MTC’s experience with direct observation using high-quality measurement systems, 
like spectrum monitoring systems, provides highly robust data. These systems include 
various components, such as spectrum analyzers, antennas, front-end components, test 
controllers, and networking equipment. The cost varies based on desired data quality, and 
the burden can be managed through internal teams or outsourcing experts. Technical 
accuracy directly correlates with equipment quality. 
In summary, HII MTC recommends investing in direct observation as the primary method for 
collecting robust data, provided it's executed by experienced experts. It has the potential to be 
cost-effective and yield high-quality data, aligning with evolving spectrum needs. 
 
i. Crowdsourcing 
Leveraging Crowdsourcing for Visibility into Utilization:  
Crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for gaining visibility into spectrum utilization. The 
FCC can encourage the public to contribute data through various means, such as smartphone 
apps or dedicated platforms. Citizens may be capable of reporting wireless device connectivity 
information through numerous automated and/or incentivized methods. These reports can report 
on qualities such as the strength of their wireless connections and network speeds. HII MTC 
considers that this approach can provide a degree of real-time insights into spectrum conditions 
across diverse geographic areas.",3,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"5 
 Accuracy and Data Uniformity:   
Crowdsourcing offers the advantage of large-scale data collection, but it comes with 
challenges. Ensuring accuracy and data uniformity can be achieved through careful design of 
data collection mechanisms. The FCC should establish clear guidelines for data reporting, 
including standardized formats, quality checks, and details about the devices used to collect data. 
User-generated data may require validation and cross-referencing with other data sources to 
ensure reliability. Setting up and maintaining a crowdsourcing data collection system may 
involve costly and timely tasks such as:  
 Developing a data submittal webpage/application 
 Developing a standardized software/application 
 Creating a certification program for data collection hardware (i.e. cellular devices, 
spectrum analyzers, radio frequency sensors, etc.) 
 Working with cellular device manufacturers and wireless carriers to allow access to 
existing receiver capabilities 
 Employing dedicated data analysts to filter and validate continuously submitted data 
 
Leveraging Smartphone Apps:  
Utilizing commercially available apps on smartphones is a practical approach, given their 
ubiquity. However, it's essential to recognize the limitations. These apps are primarily designed 
for consumer use and may be restricted, especially in relation to hardware limitations that may 
not allow access to specific frequency bands. Hardware limitations may further extend to lower-
cost and older smartphones that may not have the processing power necessary for spectrum 
monitoring applications. Battery impact should be considered and minimized through efficient 
data collection strategies. Based on many recent trends of federal government-sponsored 
smartphone applications, the FCC should follow suit and explore partnerships with app",4,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"6 
 developers to integrate spectrum monitoring capabilities. Several spectrum analyzer applications 
already exist for typical smartphones, that serve as a proof-of-concept that could be greatly 
expanded upon. 
Embedded Receiver Monitoring:  
Embedded receiver monitoring and reporting features in handheld devices is a promising 
concept. This approach minimizes the need for separate receiver monitoring infrastructure and 
can provide real-time data. Devices could passively monitor the spectrum environment and 
report relevant information automatically. HII MTC believes this would require collaboration 
with device manufacturers to implement such features. 
 
Consumer-Grade Equipment for Home Spectrum Studies:  
The NIST study during COVID-19 (a targeted campaign of spectrum measurements) 
highlighted the potential of consumer-grade equipment for spectrum studies. Guided techniques 
for sensor tuning and calibration can enhance the accuracy of data collected by non-experts. 
Consumers could use off-the-shelf devices to monitor spectrum utilization in their homes, 
contributing to a broader understanding of local spectrum conditions. 
From HII MTC's perspective, ensuring the technical accuracy and reliability of crowdsourced 
data is paramount. HII MTC can provide insights into the technical challenges of data validation, 
quality control, and cross-referencing with other sources. Additionally, HII MTC has expertise in 
designing embedded monitoring features for handheld devices, drawing from its experience with 
the RFsentry™ system. RFsentry is an advanced and comprehensive spectrum monitoring and 
management system designed to address the increasingly complex challenges associated with 
spectrum utilization. This system combines cutting-edge technology with HII MTC's vast 
expertise to provide an integrated solution for spectrum monitoring, analysis, and policy support.",5,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7 
 RFsentry incorporates powerful data analytics tools that can process vast amounts of spectrum 
data. These tools enable spectrum managers to derive meaningful insights, assess spectrum 
utilization, and make data-driven decisions for efficient spectrum management. 
In summary, crowdsourcing offers a powerful means of expanding spectrum monitoring 
capabilities. It can enhance visibility into spectrum utilization when combined with robust 
guidelines, technical validation, and collaboration with device manufacturers. As mentioned 
earlier, HII MTC recommends against the crowdsourcing approach. HII MTC's expertise 
underscores the importance of precision and reliability in implementing such approaches. 
 
ii. External Data Sources 
External data sources such as wireless carriers and 3rd party data collection/survey 
companies present a great solution for gathering data. This approach may be the quickest method 
to obtain high quality data, as external sources may already be collecting this data and 
information. External data sources have the advantage of already possessing the necessary 
infrastructure and equipment for data collection, which could reduce the complexity of 
dealmaking for the FCC to obtain this data. While this approach may seem ideal from a technical 
and time perspective, this approach would also have various cost, political, and economic 
challenges to overcome.",6,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 
 Non-Public Data Sources: 
Numerous entities, including cellular providers, wireless tower companies, satellite 
providers, and universities, gather extensive spectrum monitoring information. This data 
encompasses various aspects, such as network performance, interference reports, and usage 
patterns. Much of this data is not publicly disclosed or shared among the wireless community, 
often due to competitive advantages. 
HII MTC and others understand for instance, cellular providers collect data on signal 
strength, network congestion, and the quality of service experienced by users. As non-public 
sources continue to make their data proprietary, it is challenging to assess the cost and burden at 
this time and would be dependent on the demands from the respective sources. Therefore, it is 
uncertain what this data may cost the FCC, and whether those costs could be explicit, or 
something implicit, like more freedom in wireless operations. 
 
Usefulness and Standardization: 
The value of these non-public data sources is immense. They enable cellular providers 
and other stakeholders to optimize their networks, enhance spectral efficiency, and deliver better 
service to users. However, a significant challenge is the lack of standardization. Each entity may 
use its formats, metrics, and methodologies, making it challenging to aggregate and compare 
data across different sources.",7,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 
 Private Entity Utilization: 
Private entities use this data in several ways: 
 Network Optimization: Cellular providers, for instance, rely on this data to fine-tune their 
networks. They can identify areas with weak coverage, high congestion, or interference 
issues and take corrective actions promptly. 
 Spectral Efficiency: Companies aim to make the most efficient use of their allocated 
spectrum. This involves strategies to minimize interference, allocate resources 
dynamically, and accommodate increasing demand for wireless services. 
 
Understanding Non-Public Sources: 
To gain a better understanding of these non-public sources, it's essential for regulatory bodies 
like the FCC to engage in dialogues with industry players. HII MTC recommends establishing 
collaborative working groups or advisory panels, that can facilitate knowledge sharing and 
promote transparency. 
 
FCC Encouragement and Incentives: 
HII MTC is confident the FCC can encourage private entities to share their data by creating 
incentives. For instance, it could reduce regulatory burdens or provide access to shared resources 
in exchange for data sharing. These incentives should be designed to benefit both the data 
providers and the broader industry.",8,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"10 
 Making Data Open Source: 
While making proprietary data completely open source is challenging due to competitive 
concerns, the FCC can play a role in promoting openness. This could involve advocating for 
standardized reporting formats, ensuring data privacy and security, and facilitating the sharing of 
aggregated, anonymized data. 
Technologies and Approaches:  
The FCC can explore innovative technologies such as blockchain to ensure secure and 
auditable data sharing. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be encouraged to 
facilitate seamless data exchange between entities while maintaining security. 
Responsibility for Data Sharing Mechanism: 
HII MTC also envisions another solution could be establishing a neutral, industry-driven 
organization responsible for creating and maintaining a data sharing mechanism as a plausible 
approach. This entity should include representation from various stakeholders and uphold 
principles of fairness, transparency, and data security. 
Licensees' Data for Spectrum Utilization: 
Current spectrum licensees possess valuable data on how they use their allocated spectrum. 
This includes insights into traffic patterns, user behavior, and peak usage times. HII MTC posits 
opportunities exist for operators to share aggregated, anonymized versions of this data with the 
FCC to aid in spectrum utilization assessments. 
 
Leveraging Shared Access Frameworks: 
Shared Access Systems (SAS), like those deployed in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service 
(CBRS) band, offer real-time data on spectrum usage. The FCC can harness these frameworks to 
obtain dynamic and accurate measurements of spectrum utilization.",9,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"11 
 Assessment of Government Efforts: 
It is essential for the FCC to evaluate the effectiveness of past government initiatives aimed 
at assessing spectrum usage's impact on efficiency and sharing opportunities. The insights gained 
from these assessments can guide future policy and regulatory decisions. 
In summary, the FCC plays a pivotal role in promoting data sharing among private entities to 
enhance spectrum management. Collaboration, standardization, and well-designed incentives are 
key strategies in ensuring the FCC's actions can significantly impact the efficiency of spectrum 
utilization. Overall, the standardization and technical accuracy of the data would not likely be 
seen as a problem, as the quality and collection details would directly affect the competitive edge 
that many of these external data sources would seek. HII MTC recommends that FCC investigate 
possible external data sources for the gathering of robust data by engaging in conversations with 
sources such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, and determining what their demands may be, so 
that data sharing could be negotiated. From HII MTC's perspective, ensuring efficient spectrum 
usage aligns with our commitment to advancing cutting-edge telecommunications technologies. 
 
iii. Data Modeling and Simulation 
HII MTC agrees that data modeling and simulation, particularly through Spectrum 
Consumption Models (SCMs), play a pivotal role in spectrum management. HII MTC is pleased 
to identify the many benefits, concerns, and potential contributions in regard to the data 
modeling and simulation domain. 
Benefits of SCMs: 
1. Efficient Spectrum Management: SCMs enable regulatory bodies like the FCC to 
efficiently allocate spectrum resources by predicting utilization patterns. This aids in 
reducing interference and optimizing spectrum allocation.",10,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

measurements. They allow for scenario analysis without the need for extensive physical 
studies, potentially saving time and resources. 
3. Scenario Analysis: SCMs facilitate scenario analysis, making it possible to model 
different spectrum utilization scenarios under various conditions. This would help the 
FCC make informed decisions about spectrum allocation. 
Concerns (Challenges) of SCMs: 
1. Data Quality Dependency: The accuracy of SCMs relies heavily on the quality of input 
data. Inaccurate or outdated data can lead to unreliable models. Ensuring the integrity of 
data sources is crucial. 
2. Complexity: The level of complexity in SCMs can vary based on the chosen constructs. 
Highly detailed models may require significant computational resources and expertise to 
develop and maintain. 
3. Continuous Validation: SCMs require ongoing validation and refinement to reflect real-
world changes accurately. Regular updates and validation are essential to maintain their 
effectiveness. 
 
Alternative Algorithms:   
While SCMs are widely used, alternative algorithms such as machine learning models and 
artificial neural networks are emerging. These algorithms can offer improved accuracy in 
modeling complex spectrum usage patterns and may complement or enhance SCMs. 
 
Cost-Effective Spectrum Studies:

contribute to refining and validating these models, ensuring they accurately reflect the dynamic 
spectrum environment. While there are challenges, the benefits of SCMs and similar modeling 
approaches are significant for effective spectrum policy and management. 
 
 
iv. Direct Observation 
Direct Observation Frameworks: 
Over the past two decades, there has been a concerted effort to directly monitor the 
utilization of the radio frequency spectrum. This endeavor has proven indispensable in amassing 
authentic data regarding the utilization of various frequencies. The central question revolves 
around the effectiveness of these monitoring strategies when it comes to non-Federal spectrum 
users. Here, we delve into HII MTC's insights and evaluation of the applicability of these 
frameworks in studying non-Federal spectrum usage. 
A noteworthy proposition stemming from the NSF 2016 Workshop introduces a hierarchical 
approach known as the ""System of Systems."" This framework consists of three tiers of sensors:",13,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"15 
 high-cost, high-reliability sensors stationed at fixed locations; moderately priced sensors with 
moderate reliability dispersed more widely; and sensors harnessed from the crowd, forming the 
foundational tier. This structure is engineered to strike a balance between precision and 
coverage. 
 High-Cost/High-Trust Sensors: Typically situated at specific locations, these sensors 
provide high-fidelity data but come at a significant cost. Their reliability and 
trustworthiness render them invaluable for critical spectrum analysis. 
 Mid-Cost/Mid-Trust Sensors: Positioned across diverse geographic locations, these 
sensors achieve a harmonious equilibrium between cost-effectiveness and data accuracy, 
contributing spatial diversity in data collection. 
 Crowd-Sourced Sensors: Deployed at grassroots levels, crowd-sourced sensors constitute 
the bottom tier. While cost-effective and offering extensive coverage, the quality of their 
data may fluctuate due to the diversity of sources. 
The suitability of this hierarchy hinges on the precise objectives of spectrum studies. For 
critical applications demanding the utmost accuracy, high-cost sensors may be the preference. 
However, for broader, less critical analyses, a blend of all three tiers can furnish valuable insights 
into spectrum usage.  
NTIA's Spectrum Occupancy Measurement: 
NTIA's utilization of sensor systems to gauge Federal spectrum occupancy within the 
3.45–3.65 GHz band serves as a pragmatic exemplar of direct observation. This approach 
augments comprehension of the potential for spectrum sharing, a pivotal facet of efficient 
spectrum management. 
Data Collection from SAS Administrators:

 collection method plays a pivotal role in evaluating the effectiveness of spectrum policies and 
regulations. 
ITU's Centralized Data Reporting: 
The ITU's counsel for nations to establish centralized offices for reporting data collected 
by monitoring stations is a globally accepted approach. Through consolidating data from 
designated monitoring stations, the ITU generates periodic reports. This framework fosters 
international collaboration and offers a comprehensive panorama of spectrum utilization. 
 
Comparison with Other Methods: 
Accuracy vs. Cost:  
A pivotal consideration is whether formal monitoring endeavors, such as high-cost 
sensors or government-driven data collection, outclass alternative methods like crowdsourcing, 
modeling, and third-party data. HII MTC contends that the answer is contingent on the specific 
use case. High-cost sensors and government-driven initiatives often yield highly accurate data 
but at a substantial cost. Conversely, crowdsourcing, modeling, and third-party data can be cost-
effective but may sacrifice a degree of accuracy. 
Complementary Approaches:  
Instead of viewing these approaches as mutually exclusive, they can be seen as 
complementary. High-accuracy direct observation methods can corroborate or calibrate data 
obtained through crowdsourcing or modeling. This hybrid approach amalgamates the strengths 
of various frameworks to attain a more comprehensive comprehension of spectrum usage. 
In summation, the selection of a spectrum observation framework should harmonize with 
the study's objectives and available resources. HII MTC acknowledges that a blend of direct 
observation, modeling, and crowdsourcing can collectively enrich our insight into spectrum",15,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"17 
 usage, thereby contributing to well-informed spectrum policy and management decisions. The 
ongoing trade-off between accuracy and cost remains a central deliberation when electing the 
most apt approach for a given spectrum analysis task. 
 
HII MTC's Expertise: 
Leveraging the proficiency of HII MTC's RFsentry spectrum monitoring system, it 
becomes evident that formal monitoring endeavors yield superior accuracy due to their 
controlled conditions and specialized equipment. These efforts yield precise data regarding 
spectrum usage. Nevertheless, it's vital to grasp that there's no universal solution. Different 
methods are tailored for different purposes. HII MTC's methodology, in alignment with these 
frameworks, involves a judicious amalgamation of methods to secure the most precise insights. 
Essentially, while formal monitoring endeavors deliver heightened accuracy, it's imperative to 
appreciate the value of a comprehensive approach that amalgamates various methods. This 
approach, integrating insights from direct observation, modeling, and other sources, empowers 
well-informed decision-making in spectrum policy and management. 
Delving deeper into HII MTC's expertise in spectrum monitoring and its concurrence 
with the discussed concepts, HII MTC brings a wealth of experience to the forefront. HII MTC 
stands at the vanguard of spectrum monitoring solutions, backed by over 70 years of industry 
knowledge and a dedicated team of over 200 RF Wireless engineers and policy experts. HII 
MTC has firmly established itself as a preeminent authority in confronting intricate spectrum-
related challenges.",16,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

v. Current State of Spectrum Measurement 
Emerging Spectrum Measurement Tools 
As demand for higher quality spectrum measurements have increased in recent years, so 
too has the sophistication of equipment and associated software. Many high-end instrument 
manufacturers have strived to push past traditional device limitations in critical performance 
aspects, such as frequency range and data capture speed. Lower-cost instruments that might be 
more ideal for widespread deployment have also improved significantly as vying competition 
and cost-efficiency demands have increased. To support their evolving instruments, many of",18,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"20 
 these manufacturers have also begun to recognize the increase demand for readily available 
spectrum monitoring software tools that promote scalability and precision. 
One of the recent breakthroughs for spectrum measurement tools is the growing 
popularity of real-time spectrum analyzers (RSA), which have begun to supersede their “swept” 
spectrum analyzer predecessors in some applications. RSAs are capable of extremely fast 
spectral capture rates within a specified “instantaneous bandwidth”, allowing for more accurate 
capture of periodic signals that would go undetected in traditional swept spectrum analyzers. 
Typical superiority of RSAs only apply to measurements within their specified instantaneous 
bandwidth, but as technology continues to evolve, it is possible that these bandwidth limitations 
will eventually become insignificant. High cost RSAs are available today with significantly 
wider instantaneous bandwidths.  
 
Cost Effectiveness of Commercially Available Sensors and Specialized Equipment 
Based on the current market for spectrum monitoring and sensing technologies, it could 
be a cost-effective solution to deploy commercially available systems for measurement 
utilization, available from many manufacturers of spectrum analyzers. While this may appear 
like a straightforward approach, it comes with complexities related to setup, maintenance, and 
data processing, that all demand a specialized expertise. To be an effective product, 
commercially available systems are typically designed to be as “universal” as possible, so that 
they can be tailored to many different applications and are prone to degraded performance if not 
operated properly.  
In many applications, specialized equipment will provide superior performance and 
convenience over commercially available systems. When provided with specific measurement 
requirements, like a distinct frequency band, a customized system can typically out-perform a",19,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"21 
 commercial system in accuracy, sensitivity, and data collection rates. In some cases, costs may 
be reduced by using spectrum analyzers that do not have spectrum monitoring software readily 
available, and instead using customized software that has been tailored to the application. This 
approach offers much more flexibility in software features and ease-of-use. Customized systems 
can maximize receiver sensitivity for a desired frequency range by integrating additional 
components like filters and amplifiers, which can tune the system to focus on signals of interest 
and ignore other spectrum.  
 
Today’s Spectrum Monitoring Technology  
Spectrum monitoring technology today exists within a wide market of options that 
typically follow interoperability standards, and often have trade-offs in cost and resolution. Many 
systems could be considered as interoperable, based on the laws of physics and theory of radio 
frequency they each apply to their measured data. Typical spectrum analyzers communicate with 
a test controller via an ethernet or USB connection, using interfaces such as binary commands, 
serial commands, or Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI). Due to trade-
off’s in this technology’s cost and resolution, there is no perfect “low-cost, high-resolution” 
solution, but rather a variety of systems that can find different balances between these factors. 
Systems that do not have additional features like a display or physical user interface built in, and 
utilize an external software interface instead, can often be a good way to save on costs, without 
sacrificing resolution or performance. 
Privacy preservation should not be a concern with today’s commercially available 
spectrum monitoring technology. While it is possible to see signal characteristics in spectrum 
monitoring data, it is nearly impossible to decrypt any of the data carried without some sort of",20,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"22 
 decryption-key. Decrypting secured data would often require third party or custom software, 
along with cooperation from the personnel operating the wireless system.   
 
Measurements in Different Frequency Bands 
Generally, there should not be any specific frequency bands that would require custom-
built monitoring equipment. As previously discussed, customized equipment will always be 
preferred for maximizing performance of specific measurements. Spectrum measurement tools 
and instruments would only need to change if band allocation increases frequency to the point 
where the tools frequency limits are met. This issue may be more common in lower cost 
equipment, as higher frequency capabilities are usually associated with more expensive 
equipment. This concern could be avoided if investments were made into spectrum monitoring 
systems capable of a wide/high range of frequencies prior to deployment of the systems. 
 
How Systems Should Be Measured 
Different wireless services will often require tailored measurement approaches based on 
the mobility and directionality of the emitting system. Services deployed at a fixed location, 
employing highly directional signals, would ideally utilize a monitoring system that is deployed 
such that the receiving antenna is located within the boresight or 3 dB beamwidth of the 
transmitting system’s antenna. Data accuracy could be further enhanced if the receiving antenna 
were deployed as close as possible to the system-of-interest, as long as it is in the far field of the 
transmitting antenna. Measurement of mobile bands would require a different approach, in which 
monitoring systems would ideally need to be placed sparsely throughout an area of interest, 
utilizing omni directional antennas, or antenna arrays. Data accuracy would increase with the",21,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"23 
 number of systems deployed, and at least 3 would be required for capabilities such as signal 
direction finding/triangulation. 
Evolving service tower systems have begun to utilize new advanced antenna systems to 
avoid unnecessary blanketing of entire areas with energy, as traditional broad beamwidth 
antennas do. New antenna systems use new technologies such as beam steering via phased 
antenna arrays that allow the antenna to transmit energy in only desired directions, without 
changing physical orientation. These systems are often used in conjunction with direction finding 
receivers which can determine direction based on techniques like triangulation or time-
difference-of-arrival and help aim the transmitting system in the directions of established links. 
This technology creates challenge for deployment of spectrum monitoring equipment, and should 
generally be approached using the same methods previously discussed for mobile band 
monitoring. 
 
Spectrum Monitoring Equipment Limitations 
Based on the current market of spectrum monitoring equipment, there should not be any 
gaps in measurable spectrum bands that exist due to lack of equipment. While lower frequencies 
tend to have a much larger market of available equipment, as frequency increases, the equipment 
market becomes more limited. This is due to the higher machining precision required for higher 
frequency hardware and coaxial connectors.  
For measurement of more advance signals such as short duration, ultra-wideband, and 
spread spectrum signals, limitations for available spectrum monitoring technology will typically 
be limited to more expensive equipment that would meet the performance requirements need for 
measuring these types of signals. Low-cost equipment will often sacrifice data capture speeds for",22,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"24 
 wider frequency span captures. This should be considered when selecting a measurement 
instrument for monitoring of more complex signals.   
 
III. FURTHER STEPS 
Tailored Techniques for Specific Bands: 
In the theme of spectrum data analysis, HII MTC advocates a multifaceted approach by 
tailoring techniques to the distinctive attributes of each frequency band. Diverse bands exhibit 
unique licensing structures, usage patterns, and technical intricacies. Take, for example, cellular 
networks and satellite communication bands. They demand disparate data collection 
methodologies. Crafting tailored data collection strategies attuned to specific bands can yield 
unparalleled precision in spectrum utilization insights. 
Third-Party Data Access: 
Exploring the availability of usage data held by third parties is crucial. Many 
organizations, including private companies, research institutions, and industry associations, 
gather valuable spectrum usage information. By seeking access to these datasets, the FCC can 
enrich its understanding of how various entities utilize the spectrum. Encouraging third-party 
data sharing, while respecting privacy and security concerns, can be a fruitful approach. 
 
Data Sharing Incentives: 
The FCC can incentivize data sharing by creating policies and frameworks that promote 
collaboration. This could involve providing incentives such as reduced regulatory burden or 
access to exclusive spectrum resources for entities that contribute data. The FCC could also 
establish guidelines for data sharing agreements that protect sensitive information while 
facilitating data exchange.",23,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"25 
 Standardized Data Formats: 
The establishment of standardized data exchange formats is paramount. Specifications 
such as JSON, XML, SigMF, or SCOS are pivotal in this regard. Standardization ensures that 
data collected from heterogeneous sources can be seamlessly integrated and analyzed. SigMF, 
for instance, standardizes metadata descriptions of recorded signal data, simplifying data sharing 
and collaborative efforts. Concurrently, IEEE's SCOS standard delineates the architecture, 
interfaces, and metadata prerequisites for spectrum characterization and occupancy sensing 
systems, thereby fostering interoperability. 
 
Data Matching with NTIA: 
For consistency and efficiency, harmonizing data specifications with those maintained by 
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is advisable. Such 
alignment of data formats with existing databases streamlines data sharing between agencies. 
Importantly, it augments the overall accuracy of spectrum utilization assessments, ensuring that 
the analysis is both comprehensive and reliable. 
 
Effective Use of Data: 
The FCC must strategically identify domains where spectrum data can be most 
efficaciously employed to bolster policy decisions. Spectrum auctions, interference management, 
and spectrum allocation represent prime candidates for data-driven insights. By pinpointing these 
areas, the FCC can optimize its data collection efforts to yield maximum impact in shaping 
effective spectrum policy. 
In conclusion, the FCC's quest for an in-depth comprehension of spectrum usage 
demands a multifaceted strategy. Tailoring data collection methods to individual bands, actively",24,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"26 
 seeking third-party data, fostering data sharing through incentives and standards, harmonizing 
with NTIA, and judiciously applying data in policy decisions are pivotal steps toward advancing 
our understanding of spectrum utilization. HII MTC, with its profound expertise in spectrum 
engineering and monitoring, stands poised to play a crucial role in assisting the FCC in these 
endeavors. 
 
IV. FIELD MONITORING PILOT PROGRAM 
HII MTC envisions a field monitoring pilot program as an essential step in the evolution of 
spectrum monitoring capabilities. Such a program, followed by an exhaustive report detailing its 
findings, has the potential to furnish invaluable real-world insights into spectrum usage. It offers 
the opportunity to test and refine monitoring techniques and tools, ensuring they are adept at 
meeting the demands of an ever-evolving spectrum landscape. 
 
Defining Bands and Geographic Areas: 
A foundational decision in this endeavor lies in defining the spectrum bands and 
geographic regions for the pilot program. Band selection should mirror the spectrum of 
paramount interest, possibly spotlighting those confronting escalating congestion or pioneering 
technologies. The chosen geographic areas must encompass diverse usage scenarios, including 
urban, rural, and suburban settings. To promote a diverse collection of data geographical areas 
should encompass diverse land usage scenarios, such as urban, rural, suburban, and forested 
settings, as well as a diverse selection of cities and/or towns throughout the country.",25,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"27 
 Technical Parameters: 
Technical parameters should be carefully defined to ensure the pilot program generates 
meaningful data. Parameters may include various characteristics about both the spectrum/signals 
being measured, the parameters of the receiver being used in the measurement, such as frequency 
range, signal types, bandwidth, and sampling rates. These should align with the specific goals of 
the monitoring, whether it's detection of unwanted signals, spectrum sharing analysis, or other 
objectives.  
 
Prioritizing Specific Bands: 
Prioritizing specific bands for initial study is advisable. High-impact bands, where efficient 
usage is crucial, should be considered. Bands with emerging technologies, such as those for 5G 
or IoT, can also be a priority to understand their impact on the spectrum environment.  
 
Collaboration with Other Entities: 
HII MTC is confident that collaboration is key. Conducting the pilot program in concert 
with other agencies, universities, or private entities can enhance its scope and impact. It allows 
for leveraging a broader range of expertise, resources, and diverse geographic locations for 
monitoring. From HII MTC's vantage point, such a pilot program aligns seamlessly with the 
company's distinguished proficiency in spectrum monitoring, as epitomized by the RFsentry 
system. HII MTC stands prepared to contribute its wealth of experience in conceiving and 
deploying cutting-edge spectrum monitoring solutions. Furthermore, HII MTC can extend 
invaluable insights into the pragmatic challenges and technical intricacies inherent in field 
monitoring endeavors.",26,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"28 
 In summary, HII MTC believes a field monitoring pilot program is a promising step 
towards improving spectrum management. Defining bands, areas, and technical parameters, 
along with collaboration, is essential. It allows for the collection of valuable data that can inform 
spectrum policies and enhance spectrum efficiency. HII MTC's expertise underscores the 
importance of well-planned and collaborative initiatives in spectrum monitoring. 
 
V. NON-BINDING GUIDANCE - POLICY STATEMENT AND DATA 
SPECIFICATIONS 
Introducing non-binding guidance, either through a Policy Statement or data specifications, 
represents a commendable stride in nurturing effective spectrum management. This form of 
guidance serves as a compass, delineating best practices and offering recommended data 
definitions, structure, and formatting standards. It lays the foundation for a consistent and 
efficient evaluation of spectrum usage. 
 
Defining Problem Statements, Use Cases, and Methodology: 
Crucially, effective guidance should leave no room for ambiguity. It must vividly define 
problem statements, use cases, and the methodology for monitoring or conducting measurements 
in specific bands. This precision is pivotal, ensuring that the data collected serves a purpose and 
aligns seamlessly with the overarching objectives of spectrum management. 
 
Role of Utilization Data in Band-Specific Proceedings: 
Such guidance should also clarify the pivotal role played by utilization data in band-
specific proceedings. It should articulate how utilization data steers decisions regarding band 
allocation, sharing arrangements, interference mitigation strategies, and licensing conditions.",27,FCC NOI - Spectrum Monitoring Response.pdf,HII Mission Technologies Corp. ,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"29 
 This clarity acts as the foundation, streamlining the decision-making process and elevating 
transparency to the forefront. 
 
Framing Benefits and Limitations:   
When considering non-binding guidance, it's essential to frame both the benefits and 
limitations of utilization data transparently. The benefits include improved spectrum efficiency, 
reduced interference, and informed policymaking. However, limitations like the potential for 
data inaccuracies, privacy concerns, and the need for ongoing updates must also be 
acknowledged. From HII MTC's perspective, such guidance aligns with the company's

COMMENTS OF 
THE SOCIETY OF BROADCAST ENGINEERS, INC. 
 
The Society of Broadcast Engineers, Inc. (“SBE”)1 submits these comments in response to 
the Notice of Inquiry (the “NOI”)2 in the above-captioned proceeding. SBE supports the 
Commission taking proactive steps to better understand non-Federal spectrum utilization—
although accurately, comprehensively, and purposely assessing spectrum use will be a complex 
and multifaceted process, the information gathered may help inform effective management of 
spectrum well into the future. The FCC must approach this overarching process deliberately and 
thoughtfully, by establishing a clear series of steps from initial conceptualization to final 
implementation.  
To begin, developing a clear working definition of “spectrum use” will be essential to 
frame the numerous issues raised in, and various substantial tasks proposed by, the NOI. After a 
clear definition is established, the Commission should further prepare by studying the many and 
varying ways such defined “spectrum use” occurs, which, in turn, will permit the FCC to analyze 
and determine which measurement techniques will accurately capture such uses. Actual data

 collection should only begin once the foregoing groundwork has been laid, and the FCC should 
consider outsourcing such data collection and any corresponding technical studies to appropriate 
third-party experts rather than proceed on its own accord. 
I. 
The Definition of Spectrum “Use” Should Encompass All Types of Use the Commission 
Wishes to Study 
As the NOI thoughtfully and accurately observes, “[s]pectrum bands do not have uniform 
service requirements, operational systems, or technical characteristics.”3 Indeed, there are nearly 
as many different types of operational usage parameters and other requirements for viably utilizing 
spectrum as there are forms of spectrum authorizations made available by the FCC. This, of course, 
makes measurement of generic spectrum occupancy4 extremely complex. As a consequence, and 
for purposes of the targeted goals set forth in the NOI, before any analysis can begin the 
Commission must settle on a definition of what is to be measured . 
To truly determine “how to better obtain more sophisticated knowledge of non-Federal 
spectrum usage,”5 the definition of spectrum usage must be broad enough to encompass all types 
of non-Federal use the Commission is interested in studying. SBE therefore respectfully submits 
that to obtain a true and accurate picture of the current RF environment the definition of “spectrum 
                                                 
3 Id. ¶ 22. 
4 These comments often use the term spectrum “occupancy” interchangeably with “use” or 
“utilization.” However, there may be room for a meaningful distinction between those concepts. 
At perhaps the most fundamental level, spectrum occupancy may be viewed as an action resulting 
in a measurable change to the radio frequency environment. The concept of when collection of 
data regarding spectrum occupancy is most useful—potentially, the point where spectrum 
occupancy becomes a meaningful spectrum “use”—hinges on how significant the measurable 
change to the radio frequency environment in fact is. For example, spectrum “use” may be viewed 
as a spectrum occupancy that either is significant enough to result in a verifiable benefit for or 
service to the public, or, on the other hand, is significant enough to exclude other occupancies that 
would otherwise fit the definition of spectrum “use.” 
5 NOI ¶ 3.",1,SBE -- Comments re Understanding Spectrum Usage NOI (October 2023).pdf,THE SOCIETY OF BROADCAST ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 
 use” should account for both continuous and intermittent use—including year-round, seasonal, and 
temporary use—as well as fixed and mobile use, unlicensed use, and unauthorized use, just to 
name some of the most common types of spectrum occupancy. 
To that end, SBE tentatively supports a broad definition of use,6 but one that incorporates 
a number of technical details and subcategories. The NOI’s suggestion to break spectrum usage 
into discrete components like geographic usage, frequency usage and time usage,7 and to 
incorporate additional radio frequency engineering metrics,8 is a good place to start in this effort. 
Even this type of categorization may not effectively encompass all relevant spectrum use, however. 
Additional consideration may be needed to account for temporary or short-term spectrum uses (for 
example, broadcast auxiliary services operating pursuant to FCC Rule 74.249) and spectrum uses 
that are in violation of FCC authority (to the extent the Commission wishes to evaluate such 
unauthorized use as part of these efforts). 
II. 
Spectrum Usage Should be Studied Prior to Data Collection 
No single approach is feasible to measure spectrum occupancy. Different frequency bands 
and services have unique characteristics, and the methods used to assess occupancy must vary 
accordingly. This is a complex and challenging task, but it is essential if the Commission is to 
effectively manage the non-Federal spectrum bands. 
Given the variety of spectrum usage styles, an investigation of usage should begin with 
academic analysis involving subject matter experts from the industry and academic circles before

8 Id. ¶ 19.

"4 
 data collection begins. The numerous differences in types of spectrum usage can have a significant 
impact on the methods that are used to effectively measure occupancy. As an example, the 
broadcast industry itself utilizes spectrum in myriad ways. Some usage is fixed and continuous, 
like many television and radio broadcast streams. Other operations are intermittent and/or mobile, 
like mobile electronic newsgathering. In the case of AM radio, as the NOI notes, measured usage 
may vary significantly based on the time of day and contour being assessed.10 Data collection 
methods will need to be deliberately analyzed, selected, and tailored to capture and effectively 
compare all varying types of usage. Further, spectrum usage may change widely throughout the 
year, with some usage varying diurnally, seasonally, or otherwise—meaning some collection 
efforts may be effectively completed in less than a year, while some may necessitate years of data 
collection, averaging or other post-collection calibration, and processing.  Thus, a fulsome study 
of appropriate collection techniques across the spectrum bands should be completed before new 
technologies are brought to bear gathering data. 
The process of defining and determining effective assessment tools for the wide range of 
spectrum uses regulated by the Commission will be a colossal task, and one that may not be 
well-suited for the FCC and its existing resources. Instead, SBE respectfully submits that the most 
effective path forward would be for the Commission to employ qualified and experienced third-
party contractors and organizations to complete the scientific research and actual usage analysis 
process. In addition to ensuring that skilled and hyper-specialized industry experts are brought to 
bear on this difficult task, outsourcing would allow better tracking of the FCC’s expenses for the 
undertaking and thus aid in fairly allocating the cost of collection. Such an approach would further 
                                                 
10 See NOI ¶ 18, n.38 (noting the difficulties in measuring usage by an AM station based 
on differences in its Skywave Contour and Groundwave Contour hours).",3,SBE -- Comments re Understanding Spectrum Usage NOI (October 2023).pdf,THE SOCIETY OF BROADCAST ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 allow the FCC to continue to focus on its core mission of regulating interstate and foreign 
commerce in communication by radio, while simultaneously ensuring that usage studies are 
conducted in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
Conclusion 
The process of better understanding non-Federal spectrum usage is of great importance to 
the FCC’s efforts to effectively and efficiently manage spectrum for years to come. However, fully 
measuring and assessing spectrum usage will be difficult. 
In order to successfully meet the challenge, the Commission should carefully define 
spectrum use to encompass the wide range of usage it wishes to assess, and should employ 
qualified and specialized third parties to thoroughly study the wide range of spectrum use prior to 
beginning data collection efforts.",4,SBE -- Comments re Understanding Spectrum Usage NOI (October 2023).pdf,THE SOCIETY OF BROADCAST ENGINEERS,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

NPSTC Comments  
The Notice of Inquiry (NOI) poses numerous questions aimed at exploring the potential to 
advance the Commission’s “understanding of non -Federal spectrum usage by leveraging new data 
sources, technol ogies, and methods.”3  The NOI states that the Universal Licensing System (ULS) 
and other Commission databases provide a static record with retrievable details  on licenses and 
authorizations, but does not provide real -time information on actual use of the licensed spectrum.4

The Commission notes that past studies have concluded there “is not a one -size fits -all 
approach to measuring spectrum usage” and quest ions whether commenters agree.5  NPSTC fully 
agrees with this conclusion.  First, the a mount of spectrum dedicated for public s afety operation s 
pales in comparison to that already  provided for commercial licensed wireless systems, unlicensed 
WiFi use or the television broadcast  service.   Therefore, an assessment of public safety spectrum 
usage may provide relatively little “ban g for the buck.”   Second, any assessment must be based first 
on how spectrum is used before it attempts to determine how much  it is being used.  The 
following helps to illustrate this point .  
For public safety  and other critica l uses , design of the system must include sufficient spectrum 
capacity to accommodate a surge in communications traffic that occurs during an unplanned incident 
or even a major planned event.  That capacity may not be used every minute of every day, however it 
must be available immediately when needed , without the risk of interference .  Therefore , measuring 
public safety spec trum use and providing any mea ningful  interpretation  of the results is challenging. 6    
Knowledge of how systems work to serve a licensee’s requirements is one of the essential 
elements in avoiding false conclusions.   How much  a band is used must consider how it is used as a 
foundation for any  spectrum assessment .  As the overall spe ctrum environment includes many 
different types of uses and operational requirements, it is clear that assessment of spectrum usage is 
not a one -size-fits-all exercise.

6 NOI para graph 24  seeks comment on how to prioritize data collection.   Given the  small  amount of spectr um dedicated to 
public safety  relative to that for other services and the challenges of accurately interpreting any re sults, NPSTC believes 
prioritizing bands outside of p ublic safety  would be a better use of Commission resources.6",3,NPSTC_ Spectrum Usage NOI Comments_2023_10_03_FINAL.pdf,THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIO NS COUNCIL,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 NPSTC appreciates the Commission’s recognitio n in the NOI that spectrum use by public 
safety and  other critical operations is different than that of other licensees:  
We recognize that there are special considerations with regard to public safety and critical  
infrastructure spectrum needs. We seek com ment on defining the most appropriate met ric for 
evaluating  public safety geographic, frequency, and time usage, including how to best collect 
data on public safety  usage, who  should collect these data, and how they should protect the 
data given the specia l public safety  considerations.7 
 
Public safety spe ctrum usage indeed is unique.  Public safety s pectrum, and the 
communications it supports, draws on limited public funding , is tailored to meet the unique needs of 
each jurisdiction being served , such as  terrain, population density  includi ng seasona l differences , 
public safety agency sizes, existence of critical infrastructure and other vulnerable assets , as well  as 
potential exposure to n atural and manmade disasters .  Public safety spectrum is an es sential  tool to 
use in saving lives, not a resource to generate revenue  or support for-profit activities .   
As noted above , public safety communications systems must be designed based on the surge 
of communications traffic that will occur on the “worst day s.”  That is, the day s of an  attack at a 
school, the day s of a massive fire, the day s of a train derailment th at spreads toxic chemicals, the day s 
a tornado rips through a town, the days when a terrorist deto nates a bomb to destroy life and property, 
the d ays an apartment building or major highway bridge collapses , and the day s of a multi -vehicle 
accident and pi leup, as just some examples.   Public safety spectrum must be available and free of 
interference to support communications among 9 -1-1 professionals,  emerge ncy operations off icials, 
incident commanders,  law enforcement, fire fighters  and emergency medical services on these worst 
days, and on every day.8     
 
7 NOI at paragraph 18.   
 
8 NPSTC cautions the Commission against defining a single metric for evaluating public safety spectrum usage. See NOI 
para. 18. For example,  the NOI cites a technical case study of emergency communications during the Minneapolis bridge",4,NPSTC_ Spectrum Usage NOI Comments_2023_10_03_FINAL.pdf,THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIO NS COUNCIL,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Public safety entities use both conventio nal and trunked systems, as operational requirements, 
spectru m availability and associated rules for each band dictate.  Most p ublic safety t runked systems 
use one or more control channels  to manage the system traffic .  These control channels are always 
transmitting and therefore if monitored, would show a 10 0% occu pancy.  Howe ver, if all the 
associated traffic channels on the same system had absolute constant occupancy, an additional user 
attempting to com municate would not be able to do so.  Therefore,  what might appear on the surface 
to someone without know ledge o f the system to be a “positive” from a spectrum usage assessment  
perspective, actually would  be a significant negative from an operational standpoint.   
Given public safety communications requirement s, a key question is how the Commission 
plans to u se any additional s pectrum usage information it ultimately gathers.   In that regard, the NOI 
states the following:   
As the radiofrequency (RF) environ ment grows more congested, however, we  
anticipat e a greater need to consider such data to improve spectru m 
manag ement.…Leveraging today’s tools to understand tomorrow’s commercial  spectrum 
usage can help identify new opportunities to facilitate more efficient spectrum  use, including 
new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable co -existence among u sers an d 
services.9    
 
Most public safety communications facilities are licensed on a frequency -coordinated, site-
specific basis, with submission of technical parameters required to obtain the licen se and construction 
required to keep the license .  Furthe r, some  public safety bands have a requirement for regional plans 
that define how channels are dist ributed among entities within each region, which the Commission 
 
disaster (footnot e 40). The case study references performance metrics used to define the grade of service. However, 
performance metrics will var y considerably based on jurisdiction and sys tem use case . Thus, while it might be tempting to 
attempt to  derive a spectrum usage metric from public safety performance metrics, this da ta would not be representative 
of all public safety uses.

 has reviewed and approved.   Therefore, the Commission already has a significant amount of 
informatio n regarding public safety systems and their spectrum use.10   
Considering the information the Commission already has , and public safety’s need fo r readily 
available capacity to accommodate surg e communications requirements , it is unclear how th e 
exercise be ing contemplated in this NOI  will yield much useful additional information  regarding 
public safety spectrum usage .  Should the Commission monitor and find t hat public safety channels 
are not all 100% occupied on the given day of monitoring, it does not mean the spectr um will not be 
needed the next day, the following day, or the following week .  Public safety worst day events are not 
scheduled in a dvance.    
The Commission would better serve its goals when it comes to public safety by exploring and 
identifyin g opportunities to ensure that there is sufficient spectrum access, capacity, availability, and 
reliability to meet public safety’s needs on a n ongoing  basis.  This is particularly the case in more 
populated areas, where one or more dedicated public  safety bands are often fully allocated.11 
If/when the Commission were to embark on additional spectrum sharing through subsequent 
NPRMs, NPSTC is also concerned about interference , and expediti ous res olution when it does occur , 
despite any prevention effor ts up front.  No spectrum sharing mechanism is perfect, so it is essential 
that any spectrum sharing approach be tested in advance under real -world conditions and include a 
mechanism to identify the culprit when interference do es occur.  Public safety must  also h ave on -
demand priority and preemptive access , including during times of emergency . 
 
10 An exception is a portion of the licenses in the 4.9 GHz band that currently are jurisdictional rath er than site -specific.  
However, the Commission has already decided to gather site -specific information for those licenses going forward  as 
soon as it can implement doing so.   See Seventh Report and Order, WP Docket N o. 07-100, released January 18, 2023.    
 
11 See NTIA repo rt discussion of land mobile service allocations  https://www.ntia.gov/page/land -mobile -spectrum -
planning -options -chapter -2-spectru m-requirements  (“This congestion is particularly heavy in major metropolitan areas 
where, according to APCO, it is becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to find enough chann els to satisfy the 
demand. This is also true for Federal operations. ”)",6,NPSTC_ Spectrum Usage NOI Comments_2023_10_03_FINAL.pdf,THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIO NS COUNCIL,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"8 
 The Commission increasingly relies on automated frequency coordination and Spectrum 
Access Systems (SAS)  to implement spectrum sharing.  However, the NOI is clear tha t neith er the 
Commission  nor the licensed victim of interference would have immediate access to SAS information  
that may be needed to resolve a problem :  
While the  Commission can get access to some of the data collected and maintained by the 
SAS administra tors, t he Com mission must request such information. 47 CFR § 96.63(k). 
Additionally, much of the information collected and maintained by the SAS administrators is 
not publicly available without first being aggregated. 47 CFR § 96.55. 12 
 
Given that even the Commis sion does not have immediate access to this information , the SAS 
will not be of much help to incumbent licensees when interference does occur.   That indeed is an 
untenable situation for public safety and other critical users when consideri ng the prospe cts of any 
future spectrum sharing.    
In assessing spectrum for potential re purposing or sharing, NPSTC believes one band that 
may be a candidate for study is the VHF television ba nd. 13  As a result of transitioning over -the-air 
television fr om the analog NTS C standard to high -definition television (HDTV), numerous television 
stations have actively sought and obtained approval from the FCC to substitut e a UHF channel for 
their previously assigned VHF channel.  Accordingly, numerous licensees i n the VHF TV band  have 
already identified a viable r elocation home and have moved out of the VHF TV band.    
NPSTC does not have the data needed to analyze if/when some portion  of the TV VHF 
spectrum could be repurposed on a nationwide basis, but the activ ity it has seen i n channel 
substitut ion requests and grants indicates this is a potential band that may warrant further study.

13 NPSTC also included this recommendation in its April 17,  2023 response to the National Telecommunicati ons and 
Information Administration (NTIA) request for public comment on the development and implementation of a National 
Spectr um Strategy for t he United States . (Regulations.gov Docket No. NTIA -2023 -0003 )",7,NPSTC_ Spectrum Usage NOI Comments_2023_10_03_FINAL.pdf,THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIO NS COUNCIL,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9 
 NPSTC urges the Commission to study  its own  TV license database and consult with the National 
Association of Broadcasters as nee ded to determ ine if there are VHF channels that coul d be 
repurposed , and the timeframe under which repurposing could be accomplished .  NPSTC believes 
such an assessment of the VHF -TV spectrum could be accomplished primarily based on existing 
information, r ather than waitin g for the creation of some new and complex spectrum assessment tool.  
If possible, repurposing VHF TV channel 7 (174 -180 MHz) could potentially pr ovide the 
opportunity to pair that spectrum with current VHF mobile spectrum  in portions of t he 150 -174 MHz 
band.  VHF land mobile op erations under FCC jurisdiction can potentially suffer from additional 
interference because the spectrum does not have a plan for standard pai ring.  That leads to a more 
challenging  frequency coordination environment  as one licensee’ s base receive frequency can be 
another licensee’s base transmit frequ ency.  Implementation of improved spectrally efficient digital 
technologies has also been more challenging  at VHF because of the lack of defined channel pairs, and 
lack of available freq uencies capable of supp orting a protected service area .  In addition, NTIA may 
be aware of similar situations regarding Federal VHF land mobile operations  in the 138 -150 MHz 
spectrum  that may also benefit if sufficient TV VHF spectrum coul d be repurposed . 
Another positive step the Commission could take to enhance spectrum sharing is to issue a 
Notice of Propose d Rulemaking to modify its Part 90 rules applicable to sharing of television 
channels 14 -20 (470 -512 MHz), i.e., the T -Band , to refl ect the significa nt changes t hat have occurred 
in the spectrum environment given the transition from analog to digital television.  As addressed in a 
Petition for Rulemaking filed by the Land Mobile Communications Council (subsequently renamed 
the National  Wireless Com muni cations Council), television has transitioned to digital technology 
with corresponding changes in the TV -TV protection rules.  However, the technical rules governing",8,NPSTC_ Spectrum Usage NOI Comments_2023_10_03_FINAL.pdf,THE NATIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIO NS COUNCIL,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

 land mobile protection of TV stations in the 11 major markets wh ere the T-Band spectrum is  shared 
remain based on historical analog TV technology  no longer in use .14   
 
Conclusion   
NPSTC agrees that spectrum assessments the Commission contemplates in the NOI are 
not a one -size-fits-all exercise.  Any assessment must be based fir st on how spectru m is used 
before it attempts to determine how much  it is being used.   Public safety spectrum, and the 
communications it supports, is an essential tool to use in saving lives, not a resource to generate 
revenue.    
In the NOI, the Commissio n contemplates usi ng spectrum use assessments to facilitate 
spectrum sharing and enable co -existence among users and services.  As addressed in these 
comments, p ublic safety communications systems must be designed based on the surge of 
communications traffi c that will occur  on the “worst days.”   Therefore, measuring public safety 
spectrum use is cha llenging.  Worst day events are not planned in advance, so Commission detection 
of any availa ble capacity on a given point in time through monitoring would be meaningless.   
The Co mmission notes in the NOI that information from spectrum access systems (SAS)  is 
not publicly available, and not even available to the Commission without a request .  That means 
when interference does occur from SAS -enabled spectrum sharing , the likely  source of the 
interference would not be made known immediately, so interference is unlikely to be resolved 
expeditiously .  That situation is untenable for public safety  and o ther critical spectrum uses .   
NPSTC does recommend positive step s the Commission coul d take on spectrum sharing.  As 
part of the digital television transition, numerous TV stations have vacated VHF -TV channels and

 relocated to UHF channels.  The Commission could s tudy the possibility of repurposing portion(s) of 
the TV VHF  band.  That  study should be accomplishable with the Commission’s current database  
information  and coordi nation with industry associations , without the requirement for some new 
complex sp ectrum usage tool.  The Commission could also move forward to modify  its land 
mobile/T V sharing protection criteria based on digital TV transmissions in place, rather than on 
historical analog TV technology no longer in use , as petitioned by the Land Mobile Communi cations 
Council (subsequently renamed the National Wireless Communicatio ns Co uncil) in June 2021.  
In prioritizing  its data collection  and related  interpretation , NPSTC recommends the 
Commission use its limited resources to focus on opportunities potentially more fruitful than that 
which would be possible measurin g public safety  usage.

To:  The Commission  
COMMENTS OF AICC  
The Alarm Industry Communications Committee (“AICC”)  hereby submits comments to 
the Commission’s August 4, 2023 Notice of Inquiry in the above -captioned proceeding.1  In 
short, while AICC supports the FCC’s technical inquiry and policy of maximizing efficient use 
of spectru m generally, the Commission must be mindful of special considerations regarding 
public safety, central station alarm and critical infrastructure spectrum needs and recognize that 
there cannot be a one -size-fits-all approach to measuring spectrum usage.   AICC urges the 
Commission to be careful about using new technologies and data -driven analysis to inform 
spectrum usage policies that apply to public safety and quasi -safety radio services.   For alarm 
radios and other quasi -safety operations (as well as publi c safety operations) in the Part 90 
spectrum, crowding the channels with the maximum amount of user traffic should not be  the 
Commission’s spectrum management goal.   Instead, the public interest will be better  served by 
ensuring the small handful of UHF channels set aside for central station alarm operations are 
available at all times for alarm use, since these radios are sending messages concerning fire, 
intrusion, medical alert and other  life safety issue s.   
Introduction  
AICC represents the vast majority of entities providing central station alarm security 
protection services approved by Underwriters Laboratories, Factory Mutual, Intertek and similar 
agencies. AICC’s members fulfill a fundamental spectrum use  goal articulated by the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”). The Electronic Security Association 
(ESA) and the Security Industry Association (SIA) (representing smaller alarm dealers and alarm

 equipment manufacturers) are among the members of AICC. Central station alarm operations 
protect tens of millions of families in their homes; and they protect a wide range of hospitals, 
businesses, public utilities and key government facilities (including military installations).  These 
companies and associations are dedicated solely to “promoting the safety of life and property 
through the use of wire and radio communication.”  
Discussion  
The Commission  is interested in using new data sources, technologies  and methods (such 
as machine learning and artificial intelligence) to gain a better understanding of non -Federal 
spectrum usage and improve spectrum management.     
As a matter of policy, the Commission must avoid any increased crowding  of spectrum 
that is currently set aside for public safety, central station alarm, and critical infrastructure 
spectrum operations.  The risk of harmful interference to channel reliabil ity is far too great, and 
the vital roles  served by these public safety and quasi -safety spectrum uses are much too 
important to put at such risk.  Using big data and AI technology to squeeze additional users onto 
these limited public safety and alarm moni toring channels would not be in the public interest.  
Allowing public safety and quasi -public safety users to measure and promote efficient 
spectrum use through their various associations/trade groups ( e.g., APCO and NPSTC for public 
safety users, TMA for c entral station alarm users, UTC and AAR for critical infrastructure and 
railway users) and having trade groups prepare high -level reports on spectrum use in their 
industry would be  a better way for the Commission to achieve the spectrum monitoring goals 
that it seeks to promote in the NOI without jeopardizing the integrity of mission -critical 
communications.   
Defining Spectrum Usage  
In the NOI, the Commission seeks comment on ways to define  spectrum usage to 
appropriately capture the extent to which a set of frequencies is being utilized.  However, for 
many safety and security related spectrum applications  such as central station alarm monitoring , 
a channel is serving its intended purpose by being available  for use at any given time , 24-hours a 
day, 365 -days a year, but not necessarily being in use  at the highest level of band occupancy.  
The NOI identifies a number of different ways that spectrum usage has been defined .  NTIA and",1,AICC Comments on Spectrum Use NOI 10-2-23.pdf,AICC,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 
 NIST have defined band occu pancy as “ the percentage of frequencies or channels in the band 
with a detected signal level that exceeds a default or user -defined threshold ,”2 and in the context 
of CBRS (a commercial shared -use band) as “at any given time as the fraction of frequencies  (or 
channels) with  a detected signal level that exceeds a predetermined threshold.”3  These 
definitions may be appropriate for consumer -grade mobile services, or broadband internet 
access, but they aren’t appropriate for alarm monitoring, or other mission -critical safety and 
security services.  The taxonomy and metrics for assessing spectrum efficiency and band 
occupancy developed by the FCC’s Technological Advisory Council4 provides a better  and more 
nuanced description of spectrum use that varies  across different radio services and applications.  
A passage from the Executive Summary of the 2011 TAC Report explains the complexity in 
simple, straightforward terms:  
Just as counting the number of cars on a highway is not the only measure of a 
road’ s v alue, efficiency is not the only consideration when it comes to re -
evaluating the use of spectrum. Overall cost, quality of service, reliability, 
security and operational considerations are issues that must also be carefully 
weighed.5 
In discussing spectr um efficiency metrics for terrestrial systems, the 2011 TAC Report 
recognizes that public safety and utility systems have very rigorous QoS, coverage/reliability, 
and peak -loading requirements, which must be met for the system to be considered useful.6  The 
report also recognizes that some communications systems “must cover large geographic areas 
even though very few active users may exist per square kilometer.”7  Central station alarm 
monitoring services  may cover a higher density of customers in some  markets than others but 
QOS, coverage and reliability are mission -critical requirements.  AICC therefore strongly

 supports the 2011 TAC Report’s observation that “ [s]uch systems should not be unduly 
penalized in any spectral resource optimization attempt .”  The public’s safety and security are 
difficult metrics to quantify, but t he mission -critical nature of central station alarm 
communications calls for spectrum management policies that maximize channel availability and 
reliability rather than maximizing band occupancy or time usage.  
Band -Specific Considerations  
The Commission seeks comment on band -specific considerations that should inform its 
approach to measuring spectrum usage.  AICC agrees with experts across government, industry 
and academia who recognize there is not a one -size-fits-all approach to measuring spectrum 
usage.8  The Commission’s NOI correctly notes “that several bands may exhibit infrequent usage 
that are nonetheless mission critical for their intended uses, such as public safety.”9  The 
spectrum bands that support central station alarm operations are similar to public safety channels 
in this regard, with high reliability needs (particularly during emergencies) that may be difficult 
to quantify.   AICC looks forward to reviewing com ments from public safety and other quasi -
safety spectrum users this proceeding to help with the evaluat ion of  how underlying reliability 
and service requirements should inform the Commission’s usage analysis.  
The Commission also seeks feedback on whether s pectrum usage can or should be 
studied through representative sampling.  With respect to alarm monitoring and other emergency 
communications that are tied to incident -response, AICC believes it would be difficult for the 
FCC to gain an accurate picture of alarm channel usage through representative sampling.   As an 
alternative, the Commission should consider developing a framework so that  public safety and 
quasi -public safety users are able to measure and promote efficient spectrum use through their 
various associations/trade groups ( e.g., APCO and NPSTC for public safety users, TMA for 
central station alarm users, UTC and AAR for critical infrastructure and railway users) .  These 
trade groups could then prepare  and provide the FCC with  high-level reports on spectrum use in 
their industry .  Allowing these groups to take the lead  on spectrum usage monitoring would be  a

 better way for the Commission to achieve the policy  goals that it seeks to promote in the NOI 
without  putting the FCC into the position of collecting large amounts of potentially sensitive data 
or jeopardizing the integrity of mission -critical communications.  
Data Considerations  
The NOI seeks comment on data sources  and various aspects of data collec tion that could 
facilitate greater understanding of spectrum usage.  As noted above, having the FCC collect and 
store large amounts of data regarding the operation of central station alarm monitoring radio 
systems would pose significant liability risks for  an industry that relies on maintaining the 
highest level of security for alarm customers.   
The NOI correctly notes that collecting spectrum usage data can be costly  and 
burdensome .10  This can impose undue burdens on businesses  (and especially  small businesses ) 
that utilize radio systems in their operations but that do not derive revenues from their spectrum 
use or by making network capacity available to end users.  Central station alarm companies, like 
public safety and critica l infrastructure spectrum users, use their spectrum to promote the 
public’s safety and security and have limited resources available for collecting spectrum usage 
data.  The Commission should avoid the imposition of additional regulatory costs and burdens on 
these entities because it draws scarce resources away from the primary mission of protecting 
public safety and security.  AICC and its members strongly support the Commission’s suggestion 
that data modeling and simulations could allow for cost -effective  spectrum usage studies.   Alarm 
industry technical staff would be well positioned to help the Commission to develop its spectrum 
usage modeling for alarm monitoring channels.  Modeling would allow the Commission to 
develop the data that it is seeking to un derstand alarm channel use more quickly and effectively 
than real world monitoring, at a much lower cost and without raising data security and liability 
risks.  
CONCLUSION  
For the reasons stated above, the Commission should recognize the unique nature of 
safety -related communications by first responders, CII and central station alarm operations, and

 avoid defining efficient spectrum use to mean crowding of the channels used for these purposes.  
Instead, efficiency should be defined by the effectiveness  of such operations, demonstrated by the 
availability of channels to ensure the reliable transmission of safety -related communications.

COMMENTS OF THE  
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES’  
COMMITTEE ON RADIO FREQUENCIES  
 
 The National Academy of Sciences, through its Committee on Radio Frequencies 
(hereinafter, CORF),1 hereby submits these  comments in response to the Commission's 
August 4, 2023, Notice of Inquiry (NOI) in the above -captione d docket.  In these 
Comments, CORF notes that in defining and understanding “spectrum usage,” it is 
important to remember that passive  use (i.e., receive -only, with no transmission)  of the 
spectrum for scientific research , involving the detection and measurement of naturally 
occurring radio signals with highly sensitive radiometrically calibrated receivers , 
constitutes “usage” of the spectrum.   
 
I. Background —Passive Scientific Use of the Spectrum . 
 Scientific research through passive obs ervation at specific frequencies is 
primarily associated with Earth remote sensing, including observations of bands 
allocated to the Earth Exploration Satellite Service  (EESS)  and radio astronomy, 
including observations  in bands allocated to the Radio Astronomy Service  (RAS) . In

"2 addition, both services make critical observations in bands outside of those allocated to 
their respective services.2  
 
A. Earth Remote Sensing —The Earth Exploration Satellite Service  
 The Commission has long recognized t hat satellite -based Earth remote sensing 
is a critical and uniquely valuable resource for monitoring the state of the global 
atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere. For certain applications, satellite -based 
passive microwave remote sensing  [“EESS (passiv e)”] represents the only practical 
method of obtaining atmospheric and surface data for the entire planet.  EESS (passive) 
data have made critical contributions to the study of meteorology, atmospheric 
chemistry, climatology, and oceanography. Currently, in struments operating in the 
EESS (passive) bands provide regular and reliable quantitative atmospheric, oceanic, 
land, and cryospheric measurements to support a variety of scientific, commercial, and 
government (civil and military) data users. EESS (passive ) satellites represent billions of 
dollars in investment and provide data for major governmental users, including the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science 
Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administ ration (NASA), the 
Department of Defense (especially the U.S. Navy), the Department of Agriculture, the 
U.S. Geological Survey, the Agency for International Development, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. Forest Service. These agencies u se 
 
2 CORF recognizes that the NOI seeks comments on “ non-Federal” spectrum usage.  Passive scientific 
observation of the spectrum is performed  by both federal and non -federal entities.  While much Earth 
remote sensing is performed by federal agencies such as NOAA and NASA, an increasing amount of 
such sensing is performed by private, non-governmental entities.  The latter case would certain ly 
constitute “non -federal” usage.  While  a few U.S. radio astronomy facilities are operated by government 
agencies, the operations of most U.S. radio astronomy facilities typically are not directly contro lled by any 
federal agency , although most receive some funding from  federal agencies such as NSF and NASA .",1,CORF Comments on Understanding Spectrum Usage 23-232 (01685854xB3D1E).pdf,CORF - Committee on Radio Frequencies,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 EESS data in their work on issues impacting hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. 
economy, as well as safety of life, national security, and scientific investigation , 
particularly regarding climate change . Other countries, notably those within the 
European Union, have made comparable investments, and international agreements 
are in place to ensure continual sharing of EESS (passive) observations to inform 
operational numerical weather prediction and Earth s ystem research.  Additional 
international collaboration, mediated by the World Meteorological Organization, includes 
efforts to ensure coordination among agencies developing next -generation spaceborne 
sensor assets, including optimizing their orbital parame ters to maximize temporal and 
spatial coverage.  
 Satellite remote sensing data are an essential resource for accurate 
measurement and prediction of weather and climate . Whether collected by non -
government or government organizations, NOAA and its Nation al Weather Service are 
major users of these data. NOAA has estimated that about one -third of the U.S. 
economy —hundreds of billions of dollars annually —is sensitive to weather and climate.  
NOAA estimated that weather forecasts alone generated $35 billion in  annual economic 
benefits to U.S. households in 2016.3 NOAA has also stated that “NOAA weather 
forecasts and warnings are critical to people living in areas subject to severe weather, 
and to all Americans who depend on the economic vitality that these reg ions contribute. 
Accurate predictions of extreme weather location and severity are essential. Having

"4 time to prepare for extreme events limit their impact.”4 Furthermore, in rural areas where 
farming is the dominant source of income, accurate weather fore casting and climate 
prediction have been shown to have direct impact on investments and profits from 
agricultural products.  
 
B. The Radio Astronomy Service  
 As the Commission has long recognized, radio astronomy is a vitally important 
tool used by scientists to study the universe. It was through the use of radio astronomy 
that scientists discovered the first planets outside the solar system, circling a distant  
pulsar. The Nobel Prize –winning discovery of pulsars by radio astronomers has led to 
the recognition of a widespread population of rapidly spinning neutron stars with surface 
gravitational fields up to 100 billion times stronger than that on Earth. Subseq uent radio 
observations of pulsars have revolutionized understanding of the physics of neutron 
stars and have resulted in the first experimental evidence for gravitational radiation, 
which was recognized with the awarding of another Nobel Prize. Radio astr onomy has 
also enabled the discovery of organic matter and prebiotic molecules outside our solar 
system, leading to new insights into the potential existence of life elsewhere in the Milky 
Way Galaxy. Radio spectroscopy and broadband continuum observations  have 
identified and characterized the birth sites of stars in the Milky Way, the processes by 
which stars slowly die, and the complex distribution and evolution of galaxies in the 
universe. The enormous energies contained in the enigmatic quasars and radi o

"5 galaxies discovered by radio astronomers have led to the recognition that most 
galaxies, including the Milky Way, contain supermassive black holes at their centers, a 
phenomenon that appears to be crucial to the creation and evolution of galaxies. 
Indeed , the first image of a super massive black hole, in the M87 galaxy5—followed, 
most recently, by observations of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way6—was 
obtained by an array of radio telescopes . Synchronized observations using widely 
spaced radio telescopes around the world give extraordinarily high angular resolution, 
far superior to that which can be obtained using the largest optical telescopes on the 
ground or in space.  
 
II. Passive Scientific Observation Constitutes “Usage” of the  Spectrum.   
 Paragraphs 16-21 of the NOI seek comments on defining “usage” of the 
spectrum.  No reference  is made  therein  to passive scientific observation.  Nevertheless, 
passive scientific observation clearly constitutes “usage” of the spectrum.   
 It is essential for the Commission to recognize that passive scientific observation 
of the spectrum constitutes “usage” of the spectrum.  Such usage has wide regulatory 
recognition  throughout the world . The numerous  allocations to RAS and EESS in the

"6 domestic and international tables of allocations demonstrate that the Federal 
Communications Commission ( FCC) and the International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) both recognize that RAS and EESS constitute use of the spectrum equal to that of  
active services . Indeed, many of the allocations to RAS and EESS are the primary and 
sole service  in that particular band. See, for example , the Table of Allocations in Section 
2.106 of the Commission’s rules for 73-74.6 MHz, 1400 -1427 MHz, 1660.5 -1668.4 MHz, 
2690 -2700 MHz, and 4990 -5000 MHz.   
 In addition to frequency allocations, the FCC has recognized the importance of 
passive use of the spectrum in other regulations. Examples of geographic protection 
include Section 1.924(a ) of the Commission’s rules, which creates a National Radio 
Quiet Zone designed to protect the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green 
Bank, West Virginia, from interference. Section 1.924(d) of the Commission’s rules 
similarly establishes notificati on requirements for a “Puerto Rico Coordination Zone” 
designed to protect radio astronomy at the Arecibo Observatory.7 Non-geographic -
based protection for passive services is established in numerous other Commission 
rules.  For example, Section 15.205 of t he rules prohibits intentional emission of 
radiation from unlicensed devices in a number of bands allocated to passive services, 
including 13.36 -13.41 MHz, 25.55 -25.67 MHz, 38.0 -38.25 MHz, 73 -74.6 MHz, 401 -403 
MHz, 608 -614 MHz, 1400 -1427 MHz, 1660.5 -1668.4  MHz, 2690 -2700 MHz, 4.5-5.15 
GHz, and 5.35-5.46 GHz . 8  
 
7 See also, Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Establish a Radio Astronomy Coordination Zone in 
Puerto Rico, Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 16522 (1997).   
8 In addition, ITU  RR 5.340  and Footnote US246  state that in specific listed bands,  including bands 
allocated to passive scientific services,  “all emissions are prohibited”.",5,CORF Comments on Understanding Spectrum Usage 23-232 (01685854xB3D1E).pdf,CORF - Committee on Radio Frequencies,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"7  In sum, numerous U.S. and international regulations protect passive scientific 
observation of the spectrum . This clearly demonstrate s that such observations are 
“usage” of the spectrum.   
 Attempts to define spectrum “usage” based on metrics for “band occupancy” or 
“spectrum occupancy ,” as discussed in para. 17 of the NOI, may have limited 
usefulness when applied to passive scientific ob servations.  For example, the “band 
occupancy” metric refers to the presence of “a detected signal level that exceeds a 
default or user -defined threshold.”9 In the context of radio astronomy or Earth remote 
sensing, natural radio emissions occur at all fre quencies and arrive from all directions, 
carrying data about Earth’s  environment and the cosmos.  Certain bands, often 
associated with the natural frequencies of specific atomic and molecular emission lines, 
are particularly critical for Earth remote sensin g and astro nomy  and hence are protected 
by frequency allocations.  Yet w hile U.S. and international rules define thresholds for 
protection of these frequencies, the data are present at these  frequencies even at levels 
lower than those thresholds.   
 Similarl y, para. 17 of the NOI refers to an ITU definition of “spectrum occupancy” 
that includes use of a frequency band for “transmission of information.”10 It is certainly 
the case that there is an immense amount of data in the natural emissions that are 
observe d by Earth scientists and astronomers, and accordingly, the presence of that 
data could be argued to constitute the “transmission of information.”  That said, CORF

"8 takes no position at this time on the definition of that term ; rather , it focus es on the point 
that passive usage of the spectrum cannot be quantified through any purely 
measurement -based approach . 
 In sum , it appears that attempts to use the above -cited National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA ) and ITU definiti ons are 
likely not useful in addressing passive scientific usage of the spectrum.  Rather, as 
suggested in para. 17 of the NOI, they “obscure or limit greater comprehension” of 
passive scientific usage.  In any case, it is clear that passive scientific obser vation 
constitutes “usage” of the spectrum observed.   
 
III. Band -Specific Observations .  
 In paragraphs  22-24 of the NOI, comments are sought on whether band -specific 
considerations are relevant in understanding spectrum usage.  Para. 22 of the NOI notes  
that “ several bands may exhibit infrequent usage that are nonetheless mission critical 
for their intended uses .” For the purposes of this discussion, CORF considers “exhibit” 
in the quoted sentence to be synonymous with actual passive usage, given that, a s 
discussed previously, passive usage does not manifest in any directly -measurable 
signature in the radio spectrum . Earth remote sensing satellites typically are observing 
continuously  though not (as yet) covering all regions of the Earth at any given time ; RAS 
observatories include facilities making diverse , targeted observations  (that may 
constitute “infrequent usage”)  as well as survey instruments that operate on a 
continuous basis.",7,CORF Comments on Understanding Spectrum Usage 23-232 (01685854xB3D1E).pdf,CORF - Committee on Radio Frequencies,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"9  The natural sources of radiation measured by passive EESS applications are 
often broadband and  extremely  low power relative to the signals generated and 
received by active services.  As a result, observation over the entire allocated bandwidth 
is often required for accurate measurements.  Observed phenomena tend to be globally 
distributed as well, and observat ions are required on short timescales; given the number  
of EESS assets currently in use, each point on Earth is observed in a passive allocation 
multiple  times each day , 7 days per week.   
 The critical research performed by Earth remote sensing scientists cannot be 
performed without access to interference -free bands. A report recently released by the 
NTIA stated that “due to the extreme sensitivity required to sense physical phenomena 
such as water vapor —in different heights of the atmosphere —and ocean surface 
salinity , passive sensing bands are extremely vulnerable to interference coming from 
transmitters operating in adjacent bands with unwanted emissions extending into the 
passive band.”11 
 The natural sources of radiation measured by passive RAS applications may be 
either broadband or narrowband. They are  extremely  low power relative to the signals 
generated and received by active services.  The entire allocated bandwidth is usually 
needed for sufficient ly sensitiv e observations of  the broadband so urces. The 
narrowband sources (e.g. , the 1420 MHz emission line of neutral hydrogen) have 
varying apparent frequency depending on the relative motion  or cosmological redshift  of 
the emitting astronomical source . Observations of narrowband sources often  use the

"10 entire allocated bandwidth to measure the change in the observed frequency of the 
emission line over the field of interest (e.g. , a rotating galaxy) , which carries velocity 
information .  
 The critical scientific research undertaken by RAS observers  cannot be 
performed without access to interference -free bands. Notably, the emissions that radio 
astronomers receive are extremely weak —a radio telescope receives less than 1 
percent of one -billionth of one -billionth of a watt ( 10-20 W) from a ty pical cosmic object. 
Because radio astronomy receivers are designed to pick up such remarkably weak 
signals, radio observatories are particularly vulnerable to interference from in -band 
emissions, spurious and out -of-band emissions (OOBE) from licensed and  unlicensed 
users of neighboring bands, and emissions that produce harmonic signals in the RAS 
bands, even if those human -made emissions are weak and distant.  
 It also should be noted that scientific observation in the passive bands 
constitutes efficient u se in the sense that no observer prevents any other party from 
observing on the same frequency.  Indeed, there is essentially no limit to the number of 
parties that can observe on the same frequency , or to the number of independent 
detectors or receivers em ployed by a given passive instrument or facility . 
 
IV. Conclusion .  
 It is essential for the Commission to recognize that passive scientific observation 
of the spectrum constitutes “usage” of the spectrum.  Such usage has wide regulatory 
recognition.  The nu merous allocations to RAS and EESS in the domestic and 
international tables of allocations , and related FCC rules,  demonstrate that the FCC and",9,CORF Comments on Understanding Spectrum Usage 23-232 (01685854xB3D1E).pdf,CORF - Committee on Radio Frequencies,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Introduction	In the introduction to the FCC’s Notice of Inquiry Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, the FCC states: “Spectrum usage information is generally non-public and made available infrequently.  As the radiofrequency (RF) environment grows more congested, however, we anticipate a greater need to consider such data to improve spectrum management.  That is especially true as the burgeoning growth of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) offer revolutionary insights into large and complex datasets.  Leveraging today’s tools to understand tomorrow’s commercial spectrum usage can help identify new opportunities to facilitate more efficient spectrum use, including new spectrum sharing techniques and approaches to enable co-existence among users and services1” ASSIA has responded to a number of FCC and NTIA enquiries over the past two years related to ensuring the quality of broadband access for all Americans2,3,4,5. While the subject of these enquiries and ASSIA’s responses were specifically related to the determination of overall broadband quality provided to America’s broadband users, both wired and wireless, our observations regarding the nature of that problem and potential solutions also relate to issue raised in the current NOI, that is the availability of accurate, publicly available, and pervasive data regarding spectrum usage. Quoting the first sentence of the FCC’s introduction to the current NOI as cited above, “Spectrum usage information is generally non-public and made available infrequently” indicates that the FCC already recognizes the essence of the problem relates to public access to the “large and complex datasets” needed to understand the issues related to spectrum usage. 2.

In past reports, stakeholders have identified different approaches, including: (1) crowdsourcing, (2) external data sources, (3) modeling, and (4) direct observation”6.  • Crowdsourcing.  “… How, if at all, can we leverage crowdsourcing to gain greater visibility into utilization? Can crowdsourcing promise sufficient accuracy and data uniformity? Could the Commission leverage or extend commercially available apps to monitor occupancy through smartphones, particularly as such equipment is widely available for consumer use? Should we consider embedded “receiver monitoring and reporting” features, such as those in handheld devices?7”  • External data sources. “… enormous amount of spectrum monitoring information’ is ‘currently being collected by cellular providers, wireless tower companies, satellite providers, wireless research organizations, the federal government, and even universities.’ Many private companies have also described their own current data collection efforts. What non-public data exist from these efforts? Are such data useful or standardized? How, if at all, are private entities leveraging spectrum usage data to optimize network traffic management or use spectrum more efficiently? How can we better understand the non-public sources available? How can we encourage or incentivize access to these data?  What can we do on a going-forward basis to attain greater visibility?  Can we take action to make these data more open source? …”8.  • Data modeling and simulation “…Are there other algorithms to model spectrum usage? Could data modeling and simulations allow for cost-effective spectrum usage studies? To what extent could modeling be used to accurately reflect spectrum utilization?9  • Direct observation. “Several approaches taken over the past twenty years seek to directly observe the spectrum environment.

303 Twin Dolphin Drive. Suite 600, Redwood City, CA  94065   USA - www.assia-inc.com   -3- previous FCC and NTIA comments applies to the issues raised in the current NOI, especially those in sections 34, 35, 36, and 37.  Summarizing this commonality:  Policy decisions, whether related to ensuring broadband quality or understanding spectrum needs and optimally allocating spectrum, need be based upon pervasive and continuously collected data actually delivered to users. Such pervasive collection must be (1) secure, (2) anonymous, (3) non-interfering, (4) statistically valid, and (5) highly accurate. When based on common requirements and processes, use of information readily available in the used endpoint equipment can become a common resource that is used by government, industry, and others to understand a nation’s broadband infrastructure, which includes understanding spectrum allocation.  In the area of broadband technologies, including Wi-Fi, cellular services such as 5G, and wired broadband access, ASSIA with its ASSIA Reports project develops technologies that enable such pervasive data collection, analysis, and presentation of overall end-to-end and sectionalized performance of broadband networks. ASSIA’s technologies enable network-wide data collection and analysis that meet all five of the aforementioned requirements. This is based on instrumentation of customer premise equipment, including wireless access devices.  In some cases, this information is already collected by network operators and other service providers and the instrumentation is already available on the equipment or easily added through techniques such as firmware upgrade. The basis of this collection and analysis is performance information available from a vast majority of network users rather than a small sample of volunteers who agree to provide information. In many cases the relevant data is already collected by the user devices and can be updated in a timely manner from essentially all broadband network users, wireless and wired, while preserving anonymity, privacy, and protecting personal information. In response to the issues raised in sections 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38 of the current NOI, ASSIA proposes both an architectural framework and requirements to guide regulatory development with respect to collection, presentation, and analysis of spectrum usage and performance data from pervasively available sources.  A regulatory framework based on these requirements for data availability, collection, presentation, and analysis will help ensure that all stakeholders, e.g., the government, industry, and the public, have the information available for appropriate allocation of spectrum resources.",3,ASSIA Comment on FCC NOI on Understanding Spectrum Allocation  FCC WT Docket No. 23-232.pdf,"ASSIA - Adaptive Spectrum and Signal Alignment, Incorporated",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Data Collection and Analysis Framework ASSIA has presented a similar architectural framework in our comments to the FCC and NTIA regarding validation of broadband quality as received by end-users. 11,12,13,14 This architecture provides the basis for federated collection, analysis, and presentation of pervasively collected, anonymized data, that is statistically valid.  ASSIA believes that a similar solution will address the issues raised in understanding spectrum usage and allocation.			3.1. Data Collection and Analysis Phases The need to enable the use of commonly collected and comparable data to support disparate analysis invites the following division into process ‘phases’ for gathering and analyzing spectrum usage and allocation data:  Phase 0: Raw data and measurements are collected from network and user devices. Installing a software agent on the devices is an effective way to run tests and gather measurements.  Phase 1: Devices send data reports to a remote server or cloud database. Here, an agent is very useful for aggregating raw data. A standardized protocol is recommended for the formatting and sending of the data.   Phase 2: Determination of statistical performance across the population is performed. Histograms, max, min, average and other statistics are effective outputs of Phase 2.  Phase 3: Evaluation is performed, where metrics and figures of merit are produced and presentations generated (e.g. plots, trends, and overall scores such as the Quality of Experience Delivered (QED) metric as defined in Broadband Forum  BBF MR 452.2). Figure 1 illustrates the data collection and analysis phases.

 Figure 1 – Overview of the Phases of Data Collection and Analysis of Spectrum Related QoS and Reliability Data15 The opportunity exists, as indicated by the current NOI, for the FCC to both encourage standardization and to provide regulatory guidance to specify requirements for Phase 0 and Phase 1 data collection and aggregation of spectrum usage information. By enabling standardized and pervasive collection of data, a wide and versatile range of Phase 2 and Phase 3 data aggregation and analysis will also be enabled. With specification of the parameters and their characteristics that need to be collected in Phase 0, Phase 1 requirements would support uniform collection formats and reporting intervals. The requirements to support Phases 2 and 3 would largely relate to the analyses and presentation of the final data.  Illustrating  the importance of world-wide of frameworks that would provide pervasive, federated, and accurate measurements of broadband QoE and QoS to the governments, industry, and the public, the report of the workshop held June 20 to 21, 2023 6G and Future Wireless Systems A Joint, Member-Led Event between The Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (IVA) and The US National Academy of Engineering (NAE) emphasized the importance of pervasive and federated measurements of both QoE and QoS Quoting from the report in the section titled ‘Research Directions'16  “Foremost, the panel discussed the importance of robustness, reliability, sustainability, and packaging, pointing out there is much work yet to be done regarding the characterization of sustainability as a key performance indicator (KPI). While there is much interesting research being conducted (ORAN, for example) it is essential to focus on technology that is sufficiently scalable. The panel emphasized that mobile wireless communication should be a sort of “network of the people, for the people and by the people”, and so there must be identified KPIs that are more user-centric than technology-centric.

Further, in the report on the session titled Potential Collaboration Areas between USA and Sweden contained the following text: ""The panel identified a particular collaboration, among USA-Sweden governments and/or internet company contributions, to encourage internet service providers (ISPs) to provide data to a federated system that could be used to identify more coherently where improvements in future wireless are necessary.”17 The report concludes with a quote from a joint statement by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Sweden regarding the critical importance of the topics covered in the workshop.18 ASSIA believes that the report from this meeting underscores the vital impacts world-wide achieved by implementing the architectural framework proposed in our comment. 3.2. Broadband Data Collection Framework Uniformity	The performance and measurement requirements serve several purposes that include compliance verification with (infrastructure) grant terms, addressing third-party challenges, and assessing compliance of the FCC data collection with Congressional mandates, future policy-direction guidance, and the evolving needs of the citizens and industry. A particular system's measurements, possibly for a particular purpose, should be comparable to the same or similar measurements made by other systems for similar (and/or other) purposes. Systems that collect, store, and analyze data for these various purposes should have identical data definitions, algorithms, and presentation when the same types of data are collected and analyzed. Standardized, reusable systems and methods should be encouraged, and these systems and methods should be optimized to enable analysis and presentation.  Where there are already existing standards, these should be utilized, and when standards data formats and structures do not exist, they need be developed. Accuracy	Measurement accuracy requirements need specification. Tools and systems should enable information collection that is statistically sound from as large a sample space as possible to provide accurate consequent results across the population. Ideally, data collection is from most, if not all, customers served by a network.  17 Ibid. 18 Ibid.",6,ASSIA Comment on FCC NOI on Understanding Spectrum Allocation  FCC WT Docket No. 23-232.pdf,"ASSIA - Adaptive Spectrum and Signal Alignment, Incorporated",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

303 Twin Dolphin Drive. Suite 600, Redwood City, CA  94065   USA - www.assia-inc.com   -7- Cost	Effective	The requirements must be supportable by systems and processes that are cost effective. These systems should add little to the marginal cost of deployment, customer equipment, and support systems. Parameters can be sent from the device using standard protocols such as Broadband Forum’s TR-69 or TR-369. There should also be support for control of the collected data’s parameters and frequency of collection. Another “cost” is any adverse impact to the user’s service. This can be limited by careful specification of test and measurement procedures and methods. Software-based data collection and analysis is generally more cost effective than deploying a dedicated hardware box at the user’s premise. The most cost-effective solution is to deploy a software agent on user devices that collects data and sends it up to the cloud. Running tests to measure speed and latency generally require such an agent. The speed and latency of both the broadband connection and the Wi-Fi links can be accurately measured with an agent residing, for example, within the Wi-Fi-enabled broadband gateway at the customer’s premises. The agent can also assist in reading and averaging or otherwise combining a great many performance parameters. Support	Problem	Sectionalization	A broadband system or other network comprises a number of architectural components: the customer’s (wired and/or wireless) LAN, the broadband access itself, the middle-mile infrastructure, the backend network, and the systems providing content. Measurements of spectrum usage, congestion, and performance are but part of the overall performance of system, and understanding the effects of spectrum allocation requires that other factors affecting performance can be identified as well.  This requires that the information can support sectionalization of performance.   Clear data labeling is critical for understanding where a bottleneck occurs within the end-to-end connectivity that supports broadband applications and for identifying which service, content, or hardware provider in this end-to-end chain complies with the advertised performance parameters.  Stakeholder	Independence	Measurements and analysis of the measurements could be made by multiple sources, each a stakeholder with different and possibly conflicting interests.  The measurement and reporting systems and definitions should enable such multi-sourced measurements and ensure that the measurements are comparable regardless of source. The architectural separation of the problem of broadband data collection into the phases described in this comment will enable this independence. Privacy	The systems, requirements, and methods must ensure data anonymity, particularly protection of the consumers' personally identifiable information as an inherent quality of the systems' requirements and",7,ASSIA Comment on FCC NOI on Understanding Spectrum Allocation  FCC WT Docket No. 23-232.pdf,"ASSIA - Adaptive Spectrum and Signal Alignment, Incorporated",Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

"Before the Federal Communications Commission Washington, DC 20554  In the Matter of  Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage ) ) ) ) )  WT Docket No. 23-232  Comments of DeepSig Inc.  DeepSig Inc. is a product-centric company developing revolutionary wireless processing software solutions using cutting-edge machine learning techniques to transform 5G, sensing, and critical wireless applications. By weaving AI machine learning into radio signal processing functions, DeepSig makes the future of wireless more intelligent, efficient, autonomous, and affordable for 5G and lays the foundation for 6G. Open RAN allows for this transformation to occur by disaggregating and virtualizing the majority of 5G base station functionality on commercial servers or in the cloud. DeepSig is delivering a family of AI software products that improve wireless user experience through enhanced connectivity while reducing power consumption, costs, and providing spectrum awareness to detect security threats and interference and to help enable more efficient future spectrum sharing.     INTRODUCTION  The NOI is a timely and important inquiry; the non-federal use of spectrum is becoming increasingly complex and diverse, and it is essential that the FCC have cost-effective and scalable solutions to provide real time spectrum usage information. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be used to develop more accurate and efficient spectrum sensing and monitoring solutions. These allow us to better understand how and where spectrum is being used and to identify trends and patterns, such as the emergence of new spectrum uses and the impact of spectrum interference on different types of users. AI can also be used to automate spectrum allocation and management tasks, especially leveraging this real-time sensing information, which will improve the efficiency and flexibility of spectrum management and lead to better allocation and efficient sharing of spectrum resources.   This response will discuss the importance of understanding non-federal spectrum usage, the challenges of doing so, and the potential of AI and ML to improve our understanding of spectrum usage. We will also provide specific recommendations for the FCC on how to advance understanding of non-federal spectrum usage. The FCC can accelerate the adoption of AI in spectrum management by investing in research and development, making spectrum usage data available to AI researchers and developers, convening a working group of stakeholders from the government, industry, and academia to develop a roadmap for the use of AI in spectrum management, and by promoting the adoption of commercial AI/ML sensing and spectrum optimization techniques across public and private spectrum access systems.",0,DeepSig Comment to NOI 23-232.pdf,DeepSig Inc,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"AI SPECTRUM SENSING IS EFFICIENT, ECONOMICAL, &     ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY   Efficiency is essential to successful wireless sensing, and through automation, AI can sense and optimize spectrum utilization – far greater than that of humans and existing slow database driven methods – by identifying patterns and allocating data while providing humans and automated spectrum allocation systems with real-time information. By identifying potential congestion, interference, or spectrum underutilization, these systems can provide rapid feedback into how spectrum is allocated to provide optimal use. Without human interference, AI can adjust always ensure optimization. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of AI allow for better anticipation of network demands, ensuring that spectrum resources are always primed to handle both current and upcoming data transmission needs.  Economically, as outlined above, automated systems such as efficient AI based sensors deployed broadly, drastically reduce the need for continuous manual monitoring, translating to lower operational costs and greatly improved real time awareness of spectrum utilization. This precision negates the financial drain of overcommitting resources (e.g., spectrum) where they're redundant or, conversely, the potential lost opportunities from under provisioning or underutilization. Such judicious management of spectrum, powered by AI, directly correlates with a leaner operational budget, offering organizations a competitive edge in an ever-evolving marketplace.  Environmental considerations are increasingly at the forefront of operational decisions; spectrum sensing is not an exception. Traditional spectrum-sensing methods – reliant on energy-intensive hardware – have contributed to the rising carbon footprint of the telecommunications industry. Conversely, AI-driven, software-centric solutions require less energy, thereby curtailing environmental impact, and helping to enable more energy efficient deployment of our wireless networks by better optimizing power control, spectrum coexistence, and efficient operation   INCENTIVIZING AND PROMOTING WIRELESS SENSING  To realize the full potential of wireless sensing and spectrum utilization, the FCC should encourage and promote development and deployment of these technologies through financial, regulatory, and technical measures.    The FCC should issue cost sharing grants to organizations developing commercial solutions for wireless sensing to refine and deploy proof of concept installations. Companies at the forefront of wireless sensing are confronted with high research and development costs, and to foster innovation in and for the United States, this is essential. To this end, government financial support will stimulate further interest and private investment, allowing for a wider, faster, and more efficient technology for the public.  Investment and acceleration in technologies and solutions from small and innovative companies is critical to both efficiency in spectrum utilization and international leadership.",1,DeepSig Comment to NOI 23-232.pdf,DeepSig Inc,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Today, tens of thousands of cell towers, base stations, and satellites are equipped with radios capable of sensing a limited portion of the spectrum. These sensors are usually limited to frequencies owned or used by an entity, which does not help the broader goals of spectrum activity understanding, regulation and management. We believe that new infrastructure should have more broad integrated sensing mechanisms. Such a mandate will transfer new base stations from band-limited passive transceivers into active participants in monitoring and maintaining spectrum integrity and efficiency on a broader scale.   Public awareness of increased wireless sensing is essential. The evolution and benefits of greater sensing are clear to industry insiders; the same cannot be said for the general public. A well-informed public will result in increased public support for funding initiatives, infrastructure changes, and regulatory shifts and will result in improved competition and access for wireless systems for the general public.  INDUSTRY-FOCUSED WORKING GROUP   Collaboration is the linchpin of innovation. To date, efforts such as the SpectrumX project of the National Science Foundation have produced limited critical research and perspective, but the practicality and adaptability of commercial solutions are what breathe life into the ideas that sensing-focused labs and researchers discover and make them viable at scale for commercial deployment.  We believe that a focused working group, acting in an advisory capacity to the Commission and staff, has the potential to make the collection of data the FCC desires more efficient. Amalgamating the experience of leading technologists, innovators, and professionals with on-ground spectrum management experience, the group would produce practical solutions.  Its objectives would be multi-faceted: • Data Collection and Analysis: Efficient data collection is essential for gaining insights into non-federal spectrum usage. The group will play a pivotal role in streamlining data collection processes, ensuring data integrity, and developing analytical tools that can provide valuable information for regulatory decisions. • Regulatory Guidance: By working closely with the FCC, the working group will provide valuable regulatory guidance based on industry best practices and emerging technologies, while safeguarding spectrum integrity. • Public Awareness: Increasing public awareness of the importance of enhanced wireless sensing is a key mission of the working group. By educating the broader public about the benefits and implications of spectrum management, it aims to garner support for funding initiatives, infrastructure improvements, and regulatory reforms. • Innovation Ecosystem: The working group will act as a catalyst for the growth of an innovation ecosystem around spectrum sensing and management. It will encourage partnerships between industry players, academia, and government agencies, leading to the creation of cutting-edge technologies and solutions.",2,DeepSig Comment to NOI 23-232.pdf,DeepSig Inc,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"The strength of this working group lies in its diversity of expertise and the collaborative synergy among its members. It will bring together technologists who push the boundaries of what is possible, innovators who envision the future of wireless technology, and seasoned professionals with practical insights gained from hands-on experience in spectrum management. A group such as this will serve as a dynamic forum where ideas are incubated, tested, refined, and ultimately translated into practical solutions that have a tangible impact on non-federal spectrum management.  CONCLUSION  DeepSig Inc. underscores the significance of innovation, collaboration, and forward-thinking policy. This NOI comes at a critical time: the spectrum's diversity and complexity are increasing rapidly. Our comments have illuminated the transformative potential of AI and ML in comprehending and optimizing non-federal spectrum usage. These technologies empower us to gain deeper and more rapid and accurate insights into spectrum utilization trends, emerging applications, and interference dynamics. Moreover, they offer the promise of automating spectrum allocation and management, enhancing efficiency and flexibility.  We have outlined specific recommendations for the FCC to accelerate the adoption of AI in spectrum understanding and management. These include investment in research and development, fostering collaboration between government and industry, and making spectrum usage data available to AI researchers and developers. Efficiency, economy, and environmental sustainability form the pillars of AI-powered spectrum sensing. AI's capacity for real-time activity and pattern recognition, congestion mitigation, efficient resource allocation, and predictive analysis ensures efficient spectrum utilization. Crucially, we emphasize the formation of an industry-focused working group, uniting experts from diverse backgrounds to drive practical solutions in non-federal spectrum management, which can be deployed and scaled.   The path to advancing our understanding of non-federal spectrum usage lies in the adoption of commercial solutions. By working collectively, we can usher in an era of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable spectrum management, benefitting both industry stakeholders and the broader public. DeepSig. remains committed to contributing to this transformative journey and stands ready to support the FCC in shaping the wireless future.  /S/ James Shea  CEO, DeepSig Inc.  /S/ Tim O`Shea  CTO, DeepSig Inc.",3,DeepSig Comment to NOI 23-232.pdf,DeepSig Inc,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

Dear Ms. Dortch:  
 
AT&T  Services , Inc. , on behalf  of itself and  its affiliates ( collectively, “AT&T”), submits this 
letter to respectfully request that the above -referenced proceeding1 be reclassified from “exempt” 
to “permit -but-discl ose” under the Commission’s  ex parte  rules.2  In the Spectrum Use NOI , the 
Commission is broadly seeking to “explore the exciting potential to advance our  understanding 
of non -Federal spectrum  usage by leveraging new data sources, technologies, and  methods ” 
across the totality of Commission -regulated spectrum.3  Given the tremendous breadth of this 
undertaking, AT&T believes that it would be highly beneficial for participants to be able to 
understand and evaluate the possible benefits —and potential pitfalls —as such “ usage ” is defined 
and evaluated for the extremely wide -ranging spectrum use rs regulated by the Commission.   
That understanding would clearly be enhanced by providing all participant s with access to ex 
parte  submissions and summaries of presentations required under the permit -but-disclose rules.   
In particular, AT&T believes that smaller entities that do not have the resources to meet with the 
regulators  would benefit from being able to access a complete record of the input being received 
and assessed by the Commission  and that, conversely,  the burden of preparing notices of ex parte  
presentations  is relatively incremental for those parties that have the resources to meet with the 
Commission . 
As a final matter,  the reclassification of this proceeding to “permit -but-disclose” would be in 
keeping with the FCC’s policy of operating with transparency .  Indeed, virtually every Notice of

"2 driven analysis”. In these comments we first discuss FCC’s earlier attempts to quantify Non-Federal spectrum use and use it in policy deliberations and also some specific technical issues that have to be considered to designing measurements of spectrum usage. III. Earlier FCC Efforts The draft NOI discussion in Section B, Industry, and Academic Efforts to Study Spectrum Usage, begins with a discussion of NTIA activities “since 1973”. Due to personnel turnover and physical relocation of FCC twice in the past 25 years it is easy to understand that memory and documents in its possession on earlier activities. In an April 24, 1978 Senate appropriations hearing3, the following question and answer are documented: 
 This cites the now mostly forgotten FCC Spectrum Management Task Force of the early 1970s – not to be confused with the similarly named FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force4 of the  3 Hearing of Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, on HR 12934, April 24, 1978, Part 5 at p. 1406 (https://books.google.com/books?id=WenPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1406&lpg=PA1406&dq=%22FCC+Spectrum+Management+Task+Force%22++chicago&source=bl&ots=earDPcdHQz&sig=ACfU3U30k5cYaYbGTgss7RdP-ooCL5s8xg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjittDsxJaAAxVXElkFHV8sDuw4ChDoAXoECAQQAw#v=onepage&q=%22FCC%20Spectrum%20Management%20Task%20Force%22%20%20chicago&f=false) 4 https://transition.fcc.gov/sptf/files/SEWGFinalReport_1.pdf",1,Northeastern WIoT Docket 23-232 Comm.pdf,THE INSTITUTE FOR THE WIRELESS INTERNET OF THINGS AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY  I,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"3 early 2000s. There is little readily available information about this activity. Fortunately, there are two published papers in the IEEE’s archive that are readily available5,6. WIoT urges FCC to request from the National Archives key files of this early effort of spectrum occupancy measurement for policy purposes and to make such documents of these early efforts available to the public during the comment cycle. The 1970s FCC Spectrum Management Task Force focused on VHF and UHF bands below 1 GHz because technology for mobile use of higher bands was not yet available in that era. Its equipment was also handicapped by an earlier generation of radio receivers and electronic test and data acquisition technology than is available today that had very different cost/performance capability than today’s technologies. Nevertheless, there is good reason to believe that some lessons of these early efforts are applicable. IV. Basic Technical Issues The previous cited 1977 paper by FCC staffer Oleg Efremov was entitled “Measured VHF and UHF Signal Strength and Spectrum Occupancy Versus Antenna Height” and discusses a key phenomenon in any spectrum usage measurements: due to radio propagation issues the apparent spectrum occupancy increases with the height of the observing antenna. This point was graphically shown to one of the authors of these comments as he climbed to the summit of Japan’s Mt. Fuji, altitude 3,776 meters, carrying a handheld 2m (144-148 MHz) amateur radio transceiver. From such an altitude, most of the large cities of Japan are within the radio horizon and radio occupancy appears to be close to 100%. This raises the key question of what height  5 M. J. Toia and W.

Efremov, ""Measured VHF and UHF Signal Strength and Spectrum Occupancy Versus Antenna Height,"" IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, vol. EMC-19, no. 3, pp. 284-291, Aug. 1977, doi: 10.1109/TEMC.1977.303597.",2,Northeastern WIoT Docket 23-232 Comm.pdf,THE INSTITUTE FOR THE WIRELESS INTERNET OF THINGS AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY  I,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"4 should be used for meaningful measurements – a key topic with no well-defined answer at present. If we were to perform an Einstein-like gedanken experiment with an antenna tower comparable in height to Mt. Fuji with an antenna that could be readily moved up and down the tower for measurements at different heights, we would find large variation in apparent spectrum occupancy with antenna height. In particular, apparent occupancy would generally increase with antenna height. Thus the NOI should specifically address criteria for determining which antenna height should be used so that measurements can be both meaningful and reproduceable. Measurement Equipment Parameters There are two key, and often interrelated, parameters of measuring equipment that affect apparent occupancy: sensitivity and intermodulation generation. Sensitivity is the easier one to understand and deals with how low a signal can be detected. It is usually quantified by the “noise figure”/NF7 of the receiver used yielding a number measured in decibels/dB. Intermodulation/IM is a process in practical equipment where nonlinearities in the response of the equipment to inputs results in the generation of new signals within the equipment at frequencies that are related to the frequencies of the strong signal present. Thus two strong signals in a receiver may result in the receiver components generating apparent signals at frequencies that are the sum of the two input frequencies and the difference of them8. The vulnerability of a receiver to strong signals that generate these apparent signals at their outputs is quantified by a metric called “third-order intercept point”/IP3. For most technologies for receiver implementation increasing sensitivity generally also decreases IP3 and makes the receiver more vulnerable to intermodulation. Use of a preselector to limit the spectrum viewed by a receiver decreases IM but also decreases sensitivity. Thus the design tradeoff between NF and IP3 in measurement  7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_figure 8 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation",3,Northeastern WIoT Docket 23-232 Comm.pdf,THE INSTITUTE FOR THE WIRELESS INTERNET OF THINGS AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY  I,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"5 design is very important. In the case of cellular mobile telecommunications, the past decade has resulted in a general decrease in heights of base stations and the greatly decreased spacing of these based stations. There has also been a large increase in indoor base station use. Thus, any spectrum usage measurements should be designed to adequately measure such usage. Antenna Characteristics In order for occupancy measurements to be both meaningful and reproducible some sort of standardization of the gain characteristics of the antennas used for the measurements is necessary. It is tempting to think at isotropic antennas, with uniform gain in all azimuths and elevations, could be used but such antennas are a theoretical abstraction that can only be approximated in the real world. Traditionally occupancy measurement have be made with antenna that have uniform gain the horizontal plane and this can implemented with good accuracy.  The appropriate gain in the vertical plane and its variability with elevation angle is more complex and should be determined along with the previously mentioned antenna height issue. Nature of Transmissions Observed Unlike the case in FCC’s 1970s FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force measurements, most spectrum use today is now digital for a variety of reasons and certainly all cellular use is digital today. In the 1970s analog case, it was relatively easy to confirm that the radio channel was actually being used for real productive communications. In today’s digital case, an FCC licensee with an incentive to make its license spectrum to appear more heavily utilized than it actually is has options to create meaningless data for transmission and measurement by spectrum measurement equipment. Thus, if the measurement campaign has potential undesirable outcome",4,Northeastern WIoT Docket 23-232 Comm.pdf,THE INSTITUTE FOR THE WIRELESS INTERNET OF THINGS AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY  I,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"6 for some licensees, FCC might wish to consider adopting regulations and spot check to decrease the likelihood that a licensee could artificially increase its apparent spectrum use for regulatory gain or to avoid a penalty of some sort.

STATEMENT OF
CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re:Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket 
No. 23-232 (August 3, 2023)
Right now there are so many conversations about artificial intelligence in Washington, including 
right here at the Federal Communications Commission.  Just last month we held a joint workshop with 
the National Science Foundation to consider what AI means for communications networks.  
Let me put my cards on the table: I am much more hopeful about AI than pessimistic.  A big 
reason why is that I am an optimist by nature.  But that is not all.  After all, where you stand has a lot to 
do with where you sit.  From my perch as the head of our Nation’s expert agency on communications, I 
can’t help but be an optimist about the future of AI.
That might sound contrarian.  So much of the news about AI is dark.  How do we rein in this 
technology?  What does it mean for the future of work?  What will it mean for democracy and elections?  
What happens when AI models inherit the prejudices of the systems they are trained on and determine 
who gets a loan and who gets a job?  What does it mean for competition?  And does generative AI pose 
an existential risk to humanity that could lead to our extinction?  
These are big questions.  So let me get back to what at this agency we know best—
communications.  What we understand is that the airwaves around us are invisible infrastructure.  How 
we allocate this resource supports—and constrains—what we can do with it.  
Right now, so many of our commercial spectrum bands are growing crowded.  Hundreds of  
millions of wireless connections—from smartphones to medical sensors—are using this invisible 
infrastructure.  And that number is growing fast.  But congestion can make it harder to make room in our 
skies for new technologies and new services.  Yet we have to find a way, because no one wants 
innovation to grind to a halt.  To do this we need smarter policies, like efforts that facilitate more efficient 
use of this scarce resource.  I think of it as an abundance agenda.
Now enter AI.  A large wireless provider’s network can generate several million performance 
measurements every minute.  Using those measurements, machine learning can provide insights that help 
better understand network usage, support greater spectrum efficiency, and improve resiliency by making 
it possible to heal networks on their own.  
Today’s inquiry is a way to understand this kind of potential and help ensure it develops here in 
the United States first.  We start by focusing on spectrum utilization.  For decades in this country, we 
have licensed large slices of our airwaves and come up with unlicensed policies for joint use in others.  
This scheme is not truly dynamic.  But with demands on our airwaves growing with the internet of things, 
we want to better understand spectrum utilization in geography, frequency, and time.  This is the kind of 
data that could help make our policies smarter and more effective.  It could also help support new 
cognitive abilities that could teach our wireless devices to manage transmissions and avoid harmful 
interference on their own.  In other words, smarter radios using AI can work with each other without a 
central authority dictating the best of use of spectrum in every environment. 
If that sounds far off, it’s not.  Take a look at the work that the Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and National Science Foundation have been doing for years on this subject.  In 
particular, take a look at DARPA’s Colosseum network emulator, designed to support the development of 
new radio network technologies, and DARPA’s Spectrum Collaboration Challenge, which invited 
innovators to design new wireless networks using AI.  The final round of this challenge was held a few 
years back in Los Angeles.  Teams used AI-enabled radios to go head-to-head against each other",0,FCC-23-63A2.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

increasing efficiency and decreasing interference.  It was held in a dark auditorium in Los Angeles, but it 
was a bright look at our wireless future—I know, because I was there. 
DARPA’s Colosseum network emulator is now hosted by Northeastern University in Boston, in 
partnership with the National Science Foundation.  At the FCC, we’ve supported these efforts by 
establishing special wireless Innovation Zones in Boston to support continued work with the emulator and 
in Salt Lake City, where the National Science Foundation has set up outdoor, city-scale wireless test beds.  
But I believe we can do more to increase our understanding of spectrum utilization and support the 
development of AI tools in wireless networks.  That is what today’s inquiry is all about.  I look forward to 
the record that develops because I believe if we do this right, we can help turn spectrum scarcity into 
abundance.

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS
Re:Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage, Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket 
No. 23-232 (August 3, 2023)
As many of you know, I’ve been a consistent advocate for enhancing data-driven decision-
making.  For example, leading up to the passage of the Broadband DATA Act, I proudly championed the 
need to improve our mapping capabilities so that we can succeed in extending connectivity everywhere.  
In addition, I’ve called for the periodic evaluation of FCC programs, including initiatives focused on 
expanding spectrum availability like the Enhanced Competition Incentive Program.  And I also voiced 
concerns about the quality of data used to determine support amounts for rural hospitals and clinics—
concerns that are now steering us toward new rules that do not leave rural patients behind in the age of 
telehealth and connected medicine.  
Whether we’re deciding which way to go in a complex proceeding, or simply looking back to see 
what we’ve done well and where there’s room for improvement, having the right information at our 
fingertips can help us better serve the public and promote accountability.  And where we embrace the use 
of data already, we should continue to search for ways to enhance its accuracy, reliability, and 
completeness for the many important tasks before us.
Which brings us to today, and the important task before us.  Expanding spectrum access is 
particularly ripe for data-driven enhancements.  Even though the resource is fixed, unused amounts are 
generally falling—all while demand only continues to build.  Though the task often seems impossible, 
finding new ways to make more spectrum available is vital to our economic success and national security.  
As it turns out, developing accurate information about how we’re using spectrum today may be one of the 
best ways to ensure we have enough of it available for use tomorrow.  Better data can help us identify 
opportunities for greater usage, develop and enforce more efficient technical and service rules, and learn 
from past spectrum decisions.  
Perhaps most importantly, these benefits propagate well beyond FCC walls.  Researchers across 
industry, academia, and government regularly query our licensing databases.  With greater visibility into 
how spectrum is used, they’ll be even more able to unlock opportunities for coordination and efficient 
spectrum transactions and develop and deploy new wireless technologies.  As I mentioned in June, 
advancements in AI could be part of this story. 
Of course, there are significant and longstanding questions to be considered in this endeavor.  I

I. INTRODUCTION  
1. In this Notice of Inquiry  (NOI), we explore the exciting potential to advance our 
understanding of non -Federal spectrum usage by leveraging new data sources, technologies, and 
methods.1  While academics, industry researchers, and regulatory bodies have de voted considerable 
attention to the topic, we have traditionally relied on third parties for metrics regarding actual spectrum 
usage rather than conduct our own studies.  Spectrum usage information is generally non -public and made 
available infrequently.  As the radiofrequency (RF) environment grows more congested, however, we 
anticipate a greater need to consider such data to improve spectrum management.  That is especially true 
as the burgeoning growth of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) offer revolutionary 
insights into large and complex datasets.  Leveraging today’s tools to understand tomorrow’s commercial 
 
1 Consistent with prior analyses in this area, this NOI uses the terms “usage,” “utilization,” and “occupancy” 
interchangeably.  As discussed in section III.A., we seek comment on how best to define this concept.",0,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -63  
2 spectrum usage can help identify new opportunities to facilitate more efficient spectrum use, including 
new spectrum sharing te chniques and approaches to enable co -existence among users and services.   
2. This NOI continues our efforts to bring next -generation techniques and data -driven 
analysis to our spectrum management toolkit.  Most recently, our 2023 Spectrum Policy Statement  
outlined a refreshed set of forward -looking principles to govern the Commission’s actions and 
stakeholder expectations regarding interference, including the responsibilities of receivers to operate 
resiliently in congested spectrum bands.2  Our holistic framework seeks to keep pace with emerging 
technologies to maximize the efficient use of spectrum.   
3. In the spirit of our recent efforts, this NOI represents a technical inquiry on how to better 
obtain more sophisticated knowledge of non -Federal spectrum usage —and how we could take advantage 
of modern capabilities for doing so in a cost -effective, accurate, scalable, and actionable manner.  Given 
the technical nature of this proceeding, we do not invite comment on substantive changes to our 
underlying spectrum policies or service rules, including eligibility criteria, buildout requirements, band 
allocations, technical limitations, sharing regimes, or licensing frameworks.  We also recognize, but do 
not seek comment on, the economic or social v alue created by operators’ spectrum -based services.  
II. BACKGROUND  
A. Existing Commission Resources to Understand Spectrum Usage  
4. While the Commission tracks static spectrum allocations, assignments, and other 
characteristics in multiple ways, our existing repositories provide limited, if any, real -time data on the 
extent of actual spectrum utilization, either on a nationwide, region al, or local basis.   
5. FCC databases.   The Commission maintains “snapshot -in-time” information on spectrum 
allocations and licensees in those allocations throughout multiple databases.  As one example, the 
Universal Licensing System (ULS) maintains retrieva ble details on licensees and authorizations where the 
FCC issues individual licenses,3 including the radio service code, spectrum band, license size, applicant 
name, application purpose, and call sign.  ULS also provides capability to download data in mac hine 
readable format, which mapping software can use to display the location of authorized services.  ULS, 
however, does not contain real -time information regarding the use of licensed spectrum.  The same is true 
of the Commission’s other databases, includ ing the International Communications Filing System (ICFS), 
Experimental Licensing System (ELS), and Licensing and Management System (LMS), among others.   
6. Spectrum sharing administrators.   The FCC authorizes administrators to track spectrum 
usage data to a llow non -interfering use of shared spectrum bands.  Spectrum Access Systems (SAS) are 
systems maintained by approved third parties to monitor spectrum utilization and to coordinate activity 
among disparate services in a single band.4  White Space Database s (WSDs) and Automated Frequency 
Coordination (AFC) systems track available spectrum for opportunistic, secondary use.  However, unlike 
the SAS, the WSD and AFC do not track spectrum usage or assign users to specific channels.5

23-27, ET Docket No. 23 -122 (rel. Apr. 21, 2023) (2023 Spectrum Policy Statement).  
3 ULS does not contain information on licensees that operate under the License by Rule construct.  See, e. g., 47 CFR 
§ 95.305(b).  
4 See, e.g. , 47 CFR § 96.53.  While the Commission can get access to some of the data collected and maintained by 
the SAS administrators, the Commission must request such information.  47 CFR § 96.63(k).  Additionally, much of",1,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

the information collected and maintained by the SAS administrators is not publicly available without first being 
aggregated.  47 CFR § 96.55.   
5 However, similarly to SAS, the Commission can request the data collected and maintained by both WSD and AFC 
admini strators.  See 47 CFR §§ 15.713(k), 15.407(k).  Generally, the data collected and maintained by WSD 
administrators are also publicly available.  See 47 CFR § 15.715(m) .",1,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

3 7. Speed and drive testing.   The Commission may periodically direct mobile operators to 
conduct speed and drive testing to measure network coverage and broadband speeds in various parts of 
the United States and report those results to the Commission.  Speed tests collect information ab out the 
download speed, upload speed, and other measures affecting performance such as latency and signal 
strength.  Drive tests are a subset of speed tests, involving testing while in a vehicle or through an 
externally mounted antenna, performed either in  motion or stationary.6 
B. USG, Industry, and Academic Efforts to Study Spectrum Usage  
8. The United States government, industry, and academia have long studied ways to assess 
spectrum usage, well before the ubiquity of modern wireless services.7  Since 1973, the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has collected data on Federal use of the RF 
spectrum for its Spectrum Analysis Program.8  The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) 
operates measurement systems to help support  NTIA functions including spectrum resource assessments, 
analysis of electromagnetic compatibility problems, and interference resolution.9  The results of ITS 
surveys have been published in an ongoing series of NTIA Reports beginning in 1995.10   
9. In 2013,  the President directed NTIA to “design and conduct a pilot program to monitor 
spectrum usage in real time in selected communities throughout the country to determine whether a 
comprehensive monitoring program could disclose opportunities for more efficien t spectrum access, 
including via sharing.”11  In response to the Presidential Memorandum, the Wireless Spectrum Research 
and Development Senior Steering Group (WSRD) convened a wor kshop of policymakers, academics, and 
industry experts to “discuss how the use of spectrum data and monitoring can be used to better inform 
spectrum policy and management decisions, improve regulatory enforcement, and coordinate more 
efficient and dynamic spectrum usage.”12  While the report found that monitoring could improve spectrum 
policy and enforcement, panelists identified many challenges, including cost, the diversity of band -
specific considerations, and the need for uniform metrics and data collect ion requirements.13 
10. Following the 2013 Presidential Memorandum, NTIA developed a plan to quantitatively 
assess spectrum usage based on data reported by Federal users and validated through real -time occupancy 
measurements.14  NTIA and NIST also established the Spectrum Monitoring Pilot Program.  Among other 
things, the program sought to establish a distributed cluster of databases that collected occupancy data 
 
6 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 1.7006(e)(4).  
7 The efforts described in this section are not intended to be comprehensive .  To the extent other governmental, 
industry, or academic studies may bear  on the questions posed in this NOI, we invite commenters to discuss them.

4 from Federal users based on low -cost RF sensors developed by ITS.15  In 2016, NTIA summarized the 
results of its quantitative assessments in select Federal bands.16  This report also restated NTIA’s 
methodology to quantitatively assess Federal spectrum occupancy.17   
11. In 2016, NSF convened a workshop on spectrum measurements, which generated a report 
that featured a “high -level roadmap for a national spectrum measurement infrastructure, the architectural 
considerations, technical challenges involved in realizing such a vision and the identification of key areas 
of research needed to make this vision a reality.”18  Earlier this year, NIST held a WSRD workshop on 
obtaining better data for spectrum management, with particular focus on the challenges with obtaining, 
dissemin ating, and using th ese data for policymaking, operations, and research and development.19  
12. Federal agencies have continued to monitor band occupancy based on intervening 
regulatory and social developments.  As one example, NIST monitored spectrum usage acr oss 21 bands in 
16 locations throughout Colorado to better understand access to broadband infrastructure during the 
COVID -19 health emergency.20  Most recently, an ITS study measured band utilization in CBRS by using 
quarterly operational data from SAS adm inistrators to measure the growth of occupied CBRS channels 
and CBRS -authorized fixed stations and access points over a two -year period.21   
C. International Efforts to Monitor Spectrum Usage  
13. International Telecommunication Union.   The International Telecommu nication Union’s 
(ITU) Radio Regulations require administrations to periodically check “the emissions of stations under 
their jurisdiction.”22  This monitoring, according to the ITU, serves the objectives of facilitating spectrum 
management, resolving inte rference, ensuring acceptable reception of public broadcasting, and identifying 
non-compliant emissions.23  Article 16 establishes a framework and rules for monitoring spectrum 
utilization.24  The ITU’s International Monitoring System (IMS) consists of sta tions that collect data and 
send reports to the ITU.25  As of 2022, more than 400 monitoring stations operated across 81 countries.26

5 The ITU periodically publishes summaries based on the information it receives from these stations.27  The 
ITU Spectrum Mo nitoring Handbook also outlines principles and procedures for monitoring spectrum 
usage, including permissible equipment, technical measurements, and other requirements.  ITU -R 
Recommendations also provide guidance for monitoring systems, including their s pecified tasks, 
measurement techniques, and standard data formats.28   
14. Other jurisdictions.   National governments, through their telecommunications regulators, 
may periodically monitor spec trum usage.  In the United Kingdom, spectrum detectors are deployed 
throughout the country to aid in enforcement and to understand spectrum use in geographic areas.29  
Switzerland has deployed monitoring equipment to ensure compliance of telecommunications  systems.30  
And the Communications Research Centre Canada has developed an advanced prot otype system to create 
visualizations with spectrum monitoring data.31 
III. DISCUSSION  
15. In this NOI, we explore the feasibility, benefits, and limitations of techniques to 
understand non -Federal spectrum usage.  First, we invite comment on various aspects of spectrum usage, 
including how spectrum usage should be defined, and whether its study could generate accurate and 
actionable insights.  We then seek comment on best pract ices, operational considerations, and technical 
parameters that might correspond to different aspects of spectrum usage across different radio services.  
Next, we ask about the data necessary to study aspects of spectrum usage, and how such information 
could be obtained.  We also seek comment on the practical, technical, and legal considerations associated 
with any potential study of spectrum usage.   
A. Defining Spectrum Usage  
16. We begin our inquiry by soliciting feedback on what definitions appropriately captu re the 
extent to which a set of frequencies is being utilized.  To that end, we seek comment on previous efforts, 
both domestically and abroad, to define spectrum usage and understand its dimensions.  Are there best 
practices or consensus frameworks for as sessing aspects of spectrum usage?  What insights do different 
definitions of spectrum usage generate, and how could each inform the Commission’s potential analysis 
of the RF environment?  We encourage commenters to identify, with specificity, the benefits  and 
drawbacks of previous initiatives to define, understand, and measure spectrum usage.   
17. Spectrum usage has been defined in various ways.  In one technical paper, for instance, 
NTIA and NIST defined “band occupancy” as “the percentage of frequencies or channels in the band with 
(Continued from previous page)   
frequency (HF) monitoring and minimal space monitoring.  The stations’ activities are confined to spectrum below 
30 MHz to help public safety and federal agencies locate interference and to provide assistance during emergencies.

6 a detected signal level that exceeds a default or user -defined threshold.”32  Likewise, in its 2020 study of 
CBRS, NTIA characterized occupancy “at any given time as the fraction of frequencies (or channels) with 
a detected signal  level that exceeds a predetermined threshold.”33  The ITU defines “spectrum occupancy” 
as “the probability that, at a randomly selected moment in time, a radio channel, frequency band or other 
frequency resource being analyzed will be in use for the transmission of information.”34  In 2011, the 
Sharing Working Group of the FCC’s Technological Advisory Council (TAC) defined a taxonomy and 
metrics for assessing spectrum efficiency and occupancy for different services.35  Do commenters find 
these definit ions applicable for assessing the use of non -Federal bands?  To what extent do these 
definitions obscure or limit greater comprehension of spectrum usage?  Do any relevant differences in the 
Federal or international context make these definitions unsuitabl e here?  Are there other definitions of 
spectrum usage that might be better suited to non -Federal spectrum?  If utilization is defined as the 
exceedance of a power flux density (PFD), spectral occupancy, geographic, or other threshold, how 
should the thres hold’s values be established?  Should the threshold PFD value vary by service or 
frequency range?  Commenters should provide details and justification regarding the factors that should 
be considered in developing evaluation PFDs and how those relate to dif ferent radio services or frequency 
bands.  
18. Some studies have broken spectrum usage into discrete components, such as geographic 
usage, frequency usage, and time usage.36  We invite comment on the utility of such an approach.  We 
also seek comment on how to define these components for evaluating the intensity of spectrum use.  For 
frequency usage, what is the appropriate size of a band segment for possible study?  Should it correspond 
to authorized licenses or to an entire band or specific channels regardless  of the number of licenses?  For 
geographic usage, what principles should guide the appropriate area for study, considering differences in 
license size, population density, topology, climate, and other variables?  When evaluating the geographic 
component, comments should consider that the Commission has licensed various services over varying 
geographic regions ranging from counties to partial economic areas to the contiguous United States, and 
regions in between.  Moreover, for certain services the licensee  can request to use the spectrum at the 
locations they choose.37  With respect to time usage, could hourly, daily, or seasonal variations affect 
conclusions about spectrum usage?38  How do network peak traffic busy hours factor into spectrum

36 For example, the 2016 NTIA Quantitative Assessments Report required agencies to supply data for each system’s 
individual transmitting and receiving stations to develop an approximation of each system’s actual use of spectrum 
using parameters for frequency and bandwidth, geographic area, and estimated time of usage.  Frequency usage 
refers to the number of frequency assignments that fall within a predefined band segment.  Geographic usage refers",5,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"refers to the number of frequency assignments that fall within a predefined band segment.  Geographic usage refers 
to the percentage of the population impacted by the transmit and receive station spectrum usage contours and the 
percentage of the geographic area that is available.  Time usage refers to the duration that a station is being used.

37 See generally  47 CFR pt 90.  
38 For example, in the context of AM stations, there are difficulties associated with attempting to determine the 
frequency and time usage reflected in the difference between and AM station’s 0.5 mV/m 50 % Skywave Contour 
and its 0.5 mV/m Groundwave Contour hours.  The same Class A AM station’s Groundwave Contour may extend 
over less than one -third of that population during the daytime hours.   See, e.g. , WABC(AM), New York, NY

7 usage?39  We recognize that there are special considerations with regard to pu blic safety and critical 
infrastructure spectrum needs.  We seek comment on defining the most appropriate metric for evaluating 
public safety geographic, frequency, and time usage, including how to best collect data on public safety 
usage, who should colle ct these data, and how they should protect the data given the special public safety 
considerations.40  
19. We also seek comment on whether other components beyond geographic, frequency, and 
time usage could inform the intensity of spectrum use.  We believe oth er RF engineering metrics beyond 
the mere presence of a signal at a particular strength could shed light on spectrum usage, such as: (1) 
throughput; (2) population actually or potentially served; and (3) the number or density of end -user 
devices or access points.41  Are there other metrics that could help evaluate spectrum use, such as power 
spectral density or modulation levels?  If so, we ask commenters to describe how these metrics 
correspond to spectrum use.  For example, should the “capacity” of a syst em or its ability to 
accommodate a high density of users factor into any study of spectrum utilization?  What about the 
number of actual users compared to overall capacity, expressed as a percentage?  How should we think 
about utilization in services where  operators “spread” their capacity or “balance” their traffic dynamically 
across multiple bands and/or users?  In addressing these questions, commenters should also consider the 
appropriate methods to collect such metrics, discussed below in Section III.C.  
20. Our Spectrum Policy Statement  also noted many design techniques to help satisfy 
performance and reliability expectations, including analog and digital filtering, antenna design, adaptive 
modulation and coding techniques with error correction, dynamic fre quency selection, automatic gain 
control, intermodulation rejection, and countless other methods.  How should these features affect 
spectrum usage evaluation?  For example, how should we consider RF power at or above the sensitivity 
of receivers for a give n band?42  How should we consider uplink and downlink transmissions, and should 
we distinguish between the occupancy of transmitters and receivers?   
21. We also inquire whether metrics of spectrum usage can be combined to generate a 
holistic understanding of the RF landscape.  We note, for example, that the NTIA’s Plan for Quantitative 
Assessment of Spectrum Usage  derived a “Total Spectrum Usage” metric by aggregating components of 
frequency use, geographic use, and time of use.43  The ITU uses what it calls t he “spectrum utilization 
factor,” defined as the “product of frequency bandwidth, geometric (geographic) space, and the time

8 denied to other potential users.”44  We seek comment on whether, and to what extent, this kind of 
aggregation can supply accurate a nd actionable insights.   
B. Band -Specific Considerations  
22. Spectrum bands do not have uniform service requirements, operational systems, or 
technical characteristics.  Past efforts to study the issue have concluded that “[t]here is not a one -size-fits-
all appr oach to measuring spectrum usage.”45  Do commenters agree?  We note, for example, that several 
bands may exhibit infrequent usage that are nonetheless mission critical for their intended uses, such as 
public safety.46  If commenters agree that a band -agnos tic approach will not work, how should the 
concept of spectrum usage vary by frequency, service, or other factors?  For example, how should fixed 
point -to-point or fixed -to-multipoint services be evaluated differently from mobile services?  Should 
radioloc ation services (e.g., radar) be evaluated differently than systems that only transmit data or systems 
that use waveforms that can both transmit data and determine location?47  Should subscriber -based 
services be evaluated differently from privately control led systems?  And should services, such as those 
associated with aeronautical or maritime use or assigned for public safety , be evaluated differently than 
other services?  How should underlying reliability or service requirements inform how we consider 
usage?  How is usage impacted by access model (i.e., shared access, point -to-point, point -to-multipoint, 
broadcast, etc.)?  How should unlicensed use be factored in, if at all?  Unlicensed users operate on a non -
interference basis and in almost all cases, ope rate as an underlay to licensed or industrial, scientific, and 
medical equipment (ISM) use.  Should usage metrics be adjusted based on the geographic area over 
which a license is issued?  Given that licenses covering large geographic areas may vary between  urban, 
suburban, and rural areas, would any metrics tend to over - or understate the intensity of usage?   
23. We also solicit feedback on whether usage can or should be studied through 
representative sampling.  Participants in the NSF Spectrum Measurement Inf rastructure Workshop 
expressed reasonable support to focus on urban deployments and strong agreement that any system should 
have near continuous coverage over the deployment area.48  Should observation efforts focus on those 
types of geographic areas?   Should there be different analyses of urban, suburban, and rural 
environments?49  Can specific urban, suburban, or rural areas serve as a reliable proxy for nationwide 
conclusions?   Are there other appropriate metrics to prioritize studying spectrum usage?   
24. We next seek comment on how to prioritize data collection when each issue or band has 
its own challenges.  The 2016 NSF workshop surveyed dozens of stakeholders and experts across 
academia, industry, and federal agencies and found “strong support” for measuring traditional fixed and

commenters agree with these conclusions?  Have developme nts since 2016 shifted this priority?   
C. Data Considerations  
25. We seek comment on data sources that could facilitate greater understanding of spectrum 
usage.  We invite commenters to describe with specificity information necessary to inform elements of 
spectrum usage, along with the kinds of insights that unique data elements might produce.   
26. As a threshold matter, we first solicit feedback on our existing data sources.51  
Recognizing that our databases were not built to observe spectrum usage or collect  such data, do they 
nonetheless contain information that would be useful for such an exercise?  What data do we lack?  What 
additional data would be useful for the Commission to collect?  Do the Commission’s existing databases 
and collection procedures pro vide opportunities to obtain better information?  How should we weigh the 
benefits of collecting additional information against the burden of collecting such information?   
27. To the extent we lack information on non -Federal spectrum usage, we seek comment 
below on various aspects of data collection.  We start by considering challenges to data collection 
including cost and burden, standardization, and technical accuracy.  We then turn to various methods for 
obtaining such data.  Commenters should consider data -related questions alongside the definitional and 
band -specific issues discussed in the previous sections.  
1. Data -Related Challenges  
28. We foresee many potential challenges inherent to obtaining better data.  They include 
cost and burden; standardization; and technical accuracy.  We seek comment on these and other 
challenges, and whether the state of the art can offer solutions to overcome them.   
29. Cost and burden.   We are especially mindful of the cost and burden of collecting 
spectrum usage data.  The 2014 NIT RD Workshop Report  noted, for instance, that the “[c]ost of sensors 
for monitoring and associated data systems need to be significantly reduced to enable wide spread 
deployment and use” to assess spectrum utilization.52  That report also stressed the need to identify 
resources to defray “the costs associated with monitoring,”53 which was deemed “significant and will 
remain a barrier .”54  The 2016 NSF Workshop Report , likewise, observed that “cost considerations” would 
prevent widespread “deployment of high quality, special purpose, trusted measurement platforms.”55  
Indeed, that report found that the “top research areas” were also significant cost drivers.56  Researchers 
have also noted the significant cost of maintaining and curating vast amounts of usage d ata.57   
 
50 2016 NSF Workshop Report at 8.  
51 In addition to ULS, the FCC also maintains several other databases including the International Communications 
Filing System (ICFS), which allows for electronic filing of the following types of applications and forms: space 
station, earth station, Section 214, cable landing license, accounting rate change, recognized operating agency, 
international s ignaling point code (ISPC), data network identification code (DNIC), foreign carrier affiliation 
notification filings, and milestone/bond filings.  ICFS also provides users with a whole host of query and reporting 
options.  See https://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/ .  The OET Experimental Licensing System (ELS) allows the public to 
electronically file Forms 442, 405, 702, 703, and requests for Special Temporary Authority (STA), i nclud ing all 
necessary exhibits.  See https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/index.cfm .

10 30. We seek comment on these observations.  What are the kinds of costs that might drive 
efforts to understand spectrum usage?  Have these costs gone down in recent years due to improvements 
in technology?  Is it possible to reduce costs by leveraging  existing sources such as FCC databases, SAS 
administrators, or other existing data sources, or limiting scope by prioritizing certain bands?  Would 
reviewing the number of applications filed for new facilities, applications filed for modified facilities, as 
well as the number and nature of interference complaints filed with respect to those facilities provide 
useful data?  Would having licensees certify that their authorized facilities are operating with their 
licensed technical parameters help to verify t he data the FCC already collects?  Can the scope of data 
collection be limited to certain urban, rural, and suburban areas and serve as a proxy for the rest of the 
country?  If so, which areas?  How can we make use of resources across the country to measur e, provide, 
and assess data?  For example, can we leverage the NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative and its 
connection to university researchers to conduct measurements and report back to us in some standard 
format or database?  How should we view the costs of understanding spectrum usage relative to the 
benefits?  Is there a less burdensome or costly approach than those implemented or proposed by NTIA, 
ITU, NSF, or other bodies that would generate comparable insights?   
31. Standardization .  Prior research initi atives have noted the need to standardize data 
sources, measurement methodologies, and equipment.  The 2014 NITRD Workshop Report  noted that 
“[m]easurements are not well defined and converting measurement data into useful information is 
difficult.”58  Acco rdingly, “[r]egardless of how the data was collected and measured, the resulting 
information must mean the same thing to all stakeholders.  This may require standardizing data, and data 
collection methodologies based on the desired use, such as: location i nformation, comparing 
license/assignment data, aggregating bands, predicting interference events, etc.”59  We seek comment on 
these views.  In what ways a re existing data sources not uniform?  What challenges do non -standardized 
data sources pose for greater understanding of spectrum usage?  Do standardized data formats and 
methodologies exist today?  Can we feasibly evaluate spectrum usage if they do not?  Are there open -
source platforms or repositories that might be leveraged for cross -validation to allay standardization 
concerns?  Should a standard reporting schema be implemented?  If so, what are the data elements that 
are essential to fully evaluate spe ctrum usage?  How m any data are consistent across different radio 
services and what data elements are unique to various radio services?  How should these differences be 
accounted for?   We also seek comment on  standardization as it pertains to measurement equipment , such 
as the calibration values for antenna height and gain.   
32. Technical accuracy.   Past reports have stressed that collected data must be sufficiently 
accurate to generate trust in spectrum usage conclusions.60  These reports have observed, for ex ample, 
that sensors should have very high sensitivity to distinguish between intended signals and out -of-band 
noise. 61  In addition to accuracy, what are the technical challenges associated with collecting precise data 
given a particularly cluttered RF en vironment ?  Also, equipment should be calibrated to localize 
geographic accuracy within a specified distance, and power levels should be measured within a 
sufficiently small uncertainty.  Do these technical challenges remain today?  Could other factors 
complicate the accuracy of spectrum usage data?  We note that for certain bands, such as spectrum",9,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"sufficiently small uncertainty.  Do these technical challenges remain today?  Could other factors 
complicate the accuracy of spectrum usage data?  We note that for certain bands, such as spectrum 
licensed for flexible use, our rules generally do not require transmitter or receiver registration.  Must we 
know the location of transmitters and receivers to p roperly measure spectrum usage?  Is it possible to 
assess spectrum usage of unlicensed users or in licensed -by-rule bands?  We also note that the 2014 
NITRD Workshop  Report observed that “[d]espite the low cost, ad hoc monitoring does not produce a

11 great d eal of value and fails to generate the necessary trust in measurements.”62  Do commenters agree?  
Is there an inherent tradeoff between accuracy and expense?   
33. We also seek comment on the level of accuracy and granularity sufficient for effective 
measureme nts.  We note that previous utilization analyses defined a range of technical parameters, such 
as reference signal received power (RSRP), minimum signal -to-noise ratio, and noise -figure, as inputs for 
their models.63  What values should spectrum utilizatio n analyses consider and how should they be 
defined?  What are the right analytical models, such as propagation or network traffic models, to translate 
data into actionable information?  Can the data required for these models be passively collected or are 
there some values that will require an active network connection to help assess spectrum utilization?  To 
what extent should backhaul capacity or other network and infrastructure -related considerations factor in?  
How can we leverage AI/ML to reliably extra polate limited quantities of data?   
2. Methods for Data Collection  
34. Given the challenges of cost and burden, standardization, and technical accuracy, we seek 
comment on the benefits and drawbacks of various methods to gather more robust data.  In past reports , 
stakeholders have identified different approaches, including: (1) crowdsourcing, (2) external data sources, 
(3) modeling, and (4) direct observation.  We seek comment on the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of 
these and other techniques to understand  spectrum usage.   
35. Crowdsourcing.   The 2014 NITRD Workshop Report  recommended greater reliance on 
crowdsourcing techniques to measure utilization. 64  How, if at all, can we leverage crowdsourcing to gain 
greater visibility into utilization?  Can crowdsourcing promise sufficient accuracy and data uniformity?  
Could the Commission leverage or extend commercially available apps to monitor occupancy throu gh 
smartphones,65 particularly as such equipment is widely available for consumer use?  Should we consider 
embedded “receiver monitoring and reporting” features, such as those in handheld devices, that do not 
require user activation, to minimize separate and costly receive r monitoring infrastructure?  Additionally, 
a NIST study on usage during COVID -19 found that, due to the lockdowns in place at the time, 
researchers could develop techniques for tuning sensors when precision laboratory calibration was not 
available, as wel l as calibration methods for assembled SDRs, and assessments of the performance of 
spectrum sensors in the field.66  These techniques made it possible for non -experts to manage occupancy 
measurements in their own homes using commercial off -the-shelf device s.  Could consumers use such 
equipment to study spectrum utilization in an at -home environment?   
36. External data sources.   Participants of the 2014 NITRD Workshop acknowledged that an 
“enormous amount of spectrum monitoring information” is “currently being collected by cellular 
providers, wireless tower companies, satellite providers, wireless research organizations, the federal 
government, and even universities.”67  Many private companies have also described their own current 
data collection efforts.68  Wha t non -public data exist from these efforts?  Are such data useful or 
standardized?  How, if at all, are private entities leveraging  spectrum usage  data to optimize network 
traffic management or use spectrum more efficiently?  How can we better understand t he non -public 
sources available?  How can we encourage or incentivize access to th ese data?  What can we do on a

12 going -forward basis to attain greater visibility?  Can we take action to make th ese data more open source?  
Are there particular technologies o r approaches to facilitate data sharing?  Who should be responsible for 
establishing and maintaining a data sharing mechanism?  Additionally, do current licensees have 
sufficient data to facilitate their understanding of utilization?  What data do operator s have that could be 
made available to the FCC for spectrum utilization assessment?  How can we leverage shared access 
frameworks (e.g., SAS) to measure utilization?  To that end, we invite commenters to discuss whether  
prior United States government effor ts to assess  spectrum usage , such as those outlined in Section II.B 
above, have resulted in greater spectrum efficiency or sharing opportunities .   
37. Data modeling and simulation.   Spectrum consumption models (SCMs) identify how 
devices or systems use spectrum resources in a particular environment by capturing spectral, spatial, and 
temporal characteristics of spectrum usage for any specific transmitter, receiver, system, or collec tion of 
systems.69  Using a defined set of constructs, an SCM then translates the inputs from the various 
constructs into a model that can be used to predict the utilization of specific frequency bands.  A 2013 
MITRE report outlines 12 constructs typically  used to understand propagation, coverage, and interference 
to build an SCM.70  These constructs are then combined for the final spectrum consumption model.  We 
seek comment on the SCM approach to spectrum utilization modeling.  Are there other algorithms to 
model spectrum usage?  Could data modeling and simulations allow for cost -effective spectrum usage 
studies?  To what extent could modeling be used to accurately reflect spectrum utilization?   
38. Direct observation .  Several approaches taken over the past twenty years seek to directly 
observe the spectrum environment.71  We seek comment on whether these frameworks are suitable for 
studying non -Federal spectrum usage.72  For example, the NSF 2016 Workshop report recommended a 
“System of Systems” hierarchy of  at least three classes of sensors: (1) high cost / high trust sensors at 
 
69 Carlos E. Caicedo Bastidas et al. , A Standard Method for Modeling Spectrum Consumption , 2017 IEEE 
International Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN) (2017).  
70 The 12 constructs include (1) total power (i.e., power at the transceiver to which values of the spectrum mask, 
underlay mask, and power map refer); (2) spectrum mask (i.e., relative spectral power density of emissions by 
frequency); (3) underlay mask (i. e., relative spectral power density of allowed interference by frequency); (4) power 
map (i.e., relative power flux density per solid angle); (5) propagation map (i.e., pathloss model per solid angle); (6) 
intermodulation mask (i.e., propensity of co -locat ed signals to combine in nonlinear components of an RF system 
and be emitted by a transmitter or be received in the later stages of a receiver); (7) platform name (i.e., list of names 
of platforms on which a particular system is located); (8) location (i.e ., where system components may be used); (9) 
start time (i.e., when the model takes effect); (10) end time (i.e., when the model no longer applies); (11) minimum 
power spectral flux density (i.e., power spectral flux density that when used as part of a tra nsmitter model implies 
the geographical area in which receivers in the system are protected); and (12) protocol or policy (i.e., 
documentation accounting for system behaviors that allow different systems to be co -located and to coexist in the 
same spectrum ).  MITRE, Model -Based Spectrum Management, Part 1: Modeling and Computation Manual Version

relating to a request by an end user) as opposed to test signals that do not provide service to an end user.     
72 2016 NSF Workshop Report at 9 .  The meeting illustrated that there are a very wide range of possible and in many 
cases deployed  (at least at the prototype level) spectrum measurement architectures and the fact that no single

13 fixed locations; (2) mid -cost / mid trust sensors more widely deployed geographically between the first 
class of installations; and (3) crowd sourced sensors occupying the bottom tie r of the structure.73  In 
another example, NTIA used a system of sensors to measure Federal spectrum occupancy in the 3.45 –
3.65 GHz band to understand the potential for sharing.74  After we adopted our CBRS rules, NTIA 
collected data from SAS administrator s to quantify utilization in that bands.75  The ITU recommends that 
countries establish centralized offices to report data collected by designated monitoring stations, which 
the ITU then aggregates and summarizes for periodic reports.76  We seek comment on  these various 
frameworks, mindful of the costs associated with each.  Do formal monitoring efforts like those described 
above offer superior accuracy compared to crowdsourcing, modeling, and third -party data?  
39. We are particularly interested in the current  state of spectrum measurement tools, ranging 
from sophisticated and costly instruments to widely deployable and low -cost devices.  We also invite 
comment on the direction for emerging and future tools.  We seek comment on monitoring and sensing 
technologi es available in the market today, with special attention to cost and scale.  Can cost -effective, 
commercially available sensors be deployed to measure utilization?  Is specialized equipment needed?  
Does spectrum monitoring technology exist today that is i nteroperable, low -cost, high -resolution, and 
privacy -preserving?  Are there bands or measurements that might require custom -built monitoring 
equipment?  How would these tools differ by band allocation?  For example, how should bands with 
highly directional  signals, such as in the fixed service, be monitored differently than mobile bands?77  
How should services that use new advanced antenna systems that do not blanket an area with energy be 
evaluated compared to similarly situated licensees that use traditio nal broad beamwidth antennas?  Where 
might gaps exist due to lack of equipment for specific bands?  What limitations are there with currently 
available spectrum monitoring technology particularly with monitoring short duration, ultra -wideband, 
and spread s pectrum signals?  
D. Other Concerns  
40. Data Protection, Privacy and Security.   How should data protection, privacy, 
cybersecurity, or physical security be taken into account and inform any study of spectrum utilization?  
What role do commercial sensitivities play ?  Do current privacy laws limit the Commission’s ability to 
obtain useful spectrum utilization information?  Would aggregating, coarsening, sampling, or 
anonymizing data allay privacy concerns?78  We invite comment specifically on any limitations to our 
ability to obtain such information that might result from (1) Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
(ECPA),79 including provisions that prohibit the installation of pen register and trap and trace devices

implementing rules,81 which govern the circumstances under which a telecommunications carrier can use, 
disclose, or permit access to proprietary information about other carriers and their customers, including 
customer proprietary network information.  Do these or other laws restrict our ability to collect spectrum 
use information, whether or not through direct observation, or to gather it from third parties? Separate 
from privacy legal requ irements, are there any privacy public policy considerations that should inform the 
Commission’s approach to studying spectrum usage?

study the usage of non -Federal sp ectrum under sections 4(i), 301, 302(a), 303(e), (f), and (r), and 403 of 
the Communications Act, as amended.  We seek comment on any opportunities or limitations that our 
statutory authority under the Communications Act or any other source of authority ma y impose on our 
ability to assess utilization.  
42. Promoting Digital Equity and Inclusion .  The Commission, as part of its continuing effort 
to advance digital equity for all,82 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in 
rural o r Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely 
affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity -related considerations83 and 
benefits (if any) that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we 
seek comment on how these issues may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility, as well the scope of the Commission’s relevant legal authority.  
IV. NEXT STEPS  
43. We seek comment on what steps the Commission might take to further this inquiry.  For 
example, how might we consider other means to better understand spectrum usage?  Should the 
Commission consider different techniques for studying spectrum utilization based on the licensing and 
usage characteristics of a particular band?  Would it be advisable to consider seeking usage data held by 
third parties?  What steps might we take to encourage or incentivize data sharing?  How would we 
develop a specification that wou ld allow the exchange of data via a specific format (e.g., JSON, xml, 
SigMF ,84 SCOS ,85 etc.)?  What data exchanges might help facilitate greater understanding of spectrum 
usage?  Should our data specifications match other databases, such as those maintaine d by NTIA?  Where 
can data be used most effectively to improve policy decisions?

17 STATEMENT OF  
CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL  
 
Re: Advancing Understanding of Non -Federal Spectrum Usage , Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket  
No. 23 -232 (August 3, 2023)  
 
Right now there are so many conversations about artificial intelligence in Washington, including 
right here at the Federal Communications Commission.  Just last month we held a joint workshop wit h 
the National Science Foundation to consider what AI means for communications networks.   
Let me put my cards on the table: I am much more hopeful about AI than pessimistic.  A big 
reason why is that I am an optimist by nature.  But that is not all.  After all, where you stand has a lot to 
do with where you sit.  From my perch as the head of our Nation’s expert agency on communications, I 
can’t help but be an optimist about the future of AI.  
That might sound contrarian.  So much of the news about AI is  dark.  How do we rein in this 
technology?  What does it mean for the future of work?  What will it mean for democracy and elections?  
What happens when AI models inherit the prejudices of the systems they are trained on and determine 
who gets a loan and w ho gets a job?  What does it mean for competition?  And does generative AI pose 
an existential risk to humanity that could lead to our extinction?   
These are big questions.  So let me get back to what at this agency we know best —
communications.  What we u nderstand is that the airwaves around us are invisible infrastructure.  How 
we allocate this resource supports —and constrains —what we can do with it.   
Right now, so many of our commercial spectrum bands are growing crowded.  Hundreds of  
millions of wirel ess connections —from smartphones to medical sensors —are using this invisible 
infrastructure.  And that number is growing fast.  But congestion can make it harder to make room in our 
skies for new technologies and new services.  Yet we have to find a way, b ecause no one wants 
innovation to grind to a halt.  To do this we need smarter policies, like efforts that facilitate more efficient 
use of this scarce resource.  I think of it as an abundance agenda.  
Now enter AI.  A large wireless provider’s network can generate several million performance 
measurements every minute.  Using those measurements, machine learning can provide insights that help 
better understand network usage, support greater spectrum efficiency, and improve resiliency by making 
it possible to  heal networks on their own.   
Today’s inquiry is a way to understand this kind of potential and help ensure it develops here in 
the United States first.  We start by focusing on spectrum utilization.  For decades in this country, we 
have licensed large sl ices of our airwaves and come up with unlicensed policies for joint use in others.  
This scheme is not truly dynamic.  But with demands on our airwaves growing with the internet of things, 
we want to better understand spectrum utilization in geography, fre quency, and time.  This is the kind of 
data that could help make our policies smarter and more effective.  It could also help support new 
cognitive abilities that could teach our wireless devices to manage transmissions and avoid harmful 
interference on th eir own.  In other words, smarter radios using AI can work with each other without a 
central authority dictating the best of use of spectrum in every environment.  
If that sounds far off, it’s not.  Take a look at the work that the Defense Advanced Researc h 
Projects Agency and National Science Foundation have been doing for years on this subject.  In 
particular, take a look at DARPA’s Colosseum network emulator, designed to support the development of 
new radio network technologies, and DARPA’s Spectrum Coll aboration Challenge, which invited 
innovators to design new wireless networks using AI.  The final round of this challenge was held a few",16,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
"new radio network technologies, and DARPA’s Spectrum Coll aboration Challenge, which invited 
innovators to design new wireless networks using AI.  The final round of this challenge was held a few 
years back in Los Angeles.  Teams used AI -enabled radios to go head -to-head against each other 
demonstrating how machi ne learning can support real -time dynamic spectrum decision -making, 
increasing efficiency and decreasing interference.  It was held in a dark auditorium in Los Angeles, but it 
was a bright look at our wireless future —I know, because I was there.",16,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage

18 DARPA’s C olosseum network emulator is now hosted by Northeastern University in Boston, in 
partnership with the National Science Foundation.  At the FCC, we’ve supported these efforts by 
establishing special wireless Innovation Zones in Boston to support continued w ork with the emulator and 
in Salt Lake City, where the National Science Foundation has set up outdoor, city -scale wireless test beds.  
But I believe we can do more to increase our understanding of spectrum utilization and support the 
development of AI tool s in wireless networks.  That is what today’s inquiry is all about.  I look forward to 
the record that develops because I believe if we do this right, we can help turn spectrum scarcity into 
abundance.

19 STATEMENT OF  
COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS  
Re: Advancing Understanding of Non -Federal Spectrum Usage , Notice of Inquiry, WT Docket  
No. 23 -232 (August 3, 2023)  
 
As many of you know, I’ve been a consistent advocate for enhancing d ata-driven decision -
making.  For example, leading up to the passage of the Broadband DATA Act, I proudly championed the 
need to improve our mapping capabilities so that we can succeed in extending connectivity everywhere.  
In addition, I’ve called for the periodic evaluation of FCC programs, including initiatives focused on 
expanding spectrum availability like the Enhanced Competition Incentive Program.  And I also voiced 
concerns about the quality of data used to determine support amounts for rural hospita ls and clinics —
concerns that are now steering us toward new rules that do not leave rural patients behind in the age of 
telehealth and connected medicine.   
Whether we’re deciding which way to go in a complex proceeding, or simply looking back to see 
what we’ve done well and where there’s room for improvement, having the right information at our 
fingertips can help us better serve the public and promote accountability.  And where we embrace the use 
of data already, we should continue to search for ways to e nhance its accuracy, reliability, and 
completeness for the many important tasks before us.  
Which brings us to today, and the important task before us.  Expanding spectrum access is 
particularly ripe for data -driven enhancements.  Even though the resource i s fixed, unused amounts are 
generally falling —all while demand only continues to build.  Though the task often seems impossible, 
finding new ways to make more spectrum available is vital to our economic success and national security.  
As it turns out, deve loping accurate information about how we’re using spectrum today may be one of the 
best ways to ensure we have enough of it available for use tomorrow.  Better data can help us identify 
opportunities for greater usage, develop and enforce more efficient te chnical and service rules, and learn 
from past spectrum decisions.   
Perhaps most importantly, these benefits propagate well beyond FCC walls.  Researchers across 
industry, academia, and government regularly query our licensing databases.  With greater vis ibility into 
how spectrum is used, they’ll be even more able to unlock opportunities for coordination and efficient 
spectrum transactions and develop and deploy new wireless technologies.  As I mentioned in June, 
advancements in AI could be part of this st ory.  
Of course, there are significant and longstanding questions to be considered in this endeavor.  I 
look forward to seeing a robust record, and how best to move forward.   
I thank the staff for their hard work on this item.  It has my full support.",18,FCC-23-63A1.pdf,Commission Documents,Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage
