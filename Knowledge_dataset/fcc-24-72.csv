REPLY COMMENTS OF T -MOBILE USA , INC.  
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T -Mobile”)1/ submits these reply comments in response to the 
comments filed in the above -referenced proceeding regarding  whether and how, in light of the 
expiration of the  Commission’s authority to condu ct spectrum auctions, the  Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau  (“Bureau”)  should use its existing  regulatory tools  to provide 
access to the inventory of currently unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed for 
wireless services through auctions (“Inven tory Spectrum”).2/  Commenters broadly agree that, 
while the restoration of the Commission’s spectrum auction authority must be a Congressional 
priority, the Bureau should utilize its existing Special Temporary Authority (“STA”) framework 
so that  the publ ic can most quickly and effectively use Inventory Spectrum.  The record also 
demonstrat es that a lternative mechanisms such as dynamic spectrum sharing, issuing licens es by 
rule, and site-based licensing would be too time -consuming and complex to implement to be 
effective at making Inventory Spectrum available for what will be on ly a temporary basis .

"2 I. THE RECORD SUPPORTS AUTHORIZING INVENTORY SPECTRUM 
THROUGH THE BUREAU’S EXISTING STA FRAMEWORK  
Commenters  agree that the Bureau should make Inventory Spectrum available through 
the Commission’s STA framework.3/  Inventory Spectrum is spectrum that has already been 
made available through spectrum auctions.  And once Congress restores the Commission’ s 
spectrum auction authority, the Commission will begin the process of making Inventory 
Spectrum available again on a permanent, licensed basis through spectrum auctions.4/  
Accordingly, as commenters observe, only temporary  access to Inventory Spectrum i s required , 
and use of an STA framework is the best mechanism to achieve that result .  AT&T notes that  
using an STA model would  “enable  [Inventory Spectrum] to be rapidly put to beneficial use, 
while preserving the ability to auction these licenses in the future.”5/  Verizon concurs , stating  
that the Bureau “can use STAs to enable access to Inventory Spectrum on a temporary basis.”6/   
Further, as the Bureau recognizes, STAs are a “well -established access mechanism” that 
is familiar to providers and would be simple to administer.7/  This means that  STAs can be 
implemented quickly, without the need to establish new procedures and educate  providers on 
how to apply .  CTIA and others highlight  that the “Commission has had success in the past using 
STAs ” to grant temporary access to spectrum under extraordinary circumstances.8/  The Bureau 
should build on that success by allowing access to I nventory Spectrum through the STAs.

"3 Commenters  further support  the use of STAs because they would allow the Bureau to 
make Inventory Spectrum available under the same service rules that apply to incumbent 
operations .  That is vital because, as CTIA highlights, it would allow providers to use Inventory 
Spectrum to seamlessly supplement their networks.9/  It would also ensure that spectrum use 
under an STA is  consistent with the rules that govern license es of auctioned  spectrum , preserving 
a uniform  technical framework under which both STA holders and licensees would operate.   
More over, as AT&T observes, granting STAs under the same service rules  would  enable the 
efficient transition from STA to permanent authorization  when auction authority is restored .10/   
II. COMMENTERS AGREE THAT ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS FOR 
ASSIGNING INVENTORY SPECTRUM SHOULD BE REJECTED   
The record demonstrates that the Bureau should not adopt alternative mechanisms like 
dynamic spectrum sharing, licensing -by-rule, or site-based licensing  to make Inventory Spectrum 
available .11/  All of these proposals are permanent solutions that are poorly suited to this 
temporary problem.   Indeed, t hese alternative proposals will require time -consuming efforts to 
develop and implement .  CTIA , for example, points out that the sharing model  used in the 
Citizens Broadband Radio Service as well as the 6 GHz Automated Frequency Coordination 
framework  have taken years to develop and implement.12/  But taking the time to develop these 
framework s would defeat the very purpose of this proceeding – to make spectrum available only

"4 while the FCC’s spectrum auction authority has expired.13/  By the time any of these sharing 
mechanism are implemented , Inventory Spectrum could likely be put to auction , obviating the 
need for such mechanisms . 
In addition , these alternative mechanisms would  threaten to upset the existing 
frameworks for the spectrum bands at issue.   The time to consider alternative proposals , like 
spectrum sharing , is when the Commission is considering opening a new band for expanded use.  
But for Inventory Spectrum, which ha s already been subject to auction, the introduction of 
sharing or other alternative mechanisms would disrupt  the established and successful licensing 
and operating rules that are already in place .14/  As CTIA cautions , introducing new use  
framework s subjec t to different technical and operating parameters  “would be a legally 
vulnerable infringement on existing licensees’ rights, disrupt and fragment the existing spectrum 
environment, undermine investment, and introduce the potential for harmful interference to 
existing co - and adjacent -band licensees.”15/  The Bureau  should , as AT&T and Verizon contend,  
avoid taking any action that could impact the rights of existing licensees .16/   
III. THE BUREAU SHOULD REJECT CALLS TO RECONSIDER RULES 
UNRELATED TO PROVIDING TEMPORARY ACCESS TO INVENTORY 
SPECTRUM  
Finally, contrary to the claims of some parties, this proceeding should not be used as an 
opportunity to revisit rules unrelated to the temporary use of Inventory Spectrum.  In particular , 
the Bureau should not re -evaluate eligibility for Inventory S pectru m.  There was  no “right of first 
refusal” for non -incumbent carriers, as EchoStar proposes , for Inventory Spectrum when it was

"5 made available for auction.17/  Therefore, there should be no “right of first refusal” for Inventory 
Spectrum now.  To the contra ry, Inventory S pectrum should be authorized for use by those that 
can use it the most quickly, efficiently, and effectively.18/  That means , as AT&T suggests, that  
the Bureau should ensure that Inventory Spectrum is made available to existing licensees tha t can 
integrate the spectrum into their existing networks, without requiring new builds.19/   
Nor is this proceeding an opportunity for the Bureau to reconsider whether auctions 
should be used at all to license the Inventory Spectrum.20/  As an initial mat ter, Section 309(j) of 
the Communications act directs the Commission to conduct auctions to select among mutually 
exclusive applications in most instances.21/  That Congressional determination remains sound  and 
the Commission’s ability to use this critical  tool will soon be restored .  As CTIA explains, 
spectrum auctions “drive market -based competition, ensuring spectrum is allocated to its highest 
use while encouraging providers to invest billions each year to build and improve the world’s 
most robust wireless networks. ”22/  The Bureau has further explained that the competition 
fostered by spectrum auctions ensures that “the Nation’s scarce spectrum resources are put to 
their highest and best use” by assigning spectrum to the party that values it the mo st.23/

"6 When the Commission adopts  rules  governing how spectrum will be licensed, it makes a 
related determination regarding the associated auction rules.24/  That has already occurred with 
respect to the Inventory Spectrum.  Accordingly, parties who now seek to change how the 
Inventory Spectrum is licensed are asking the Commission to modify or reconsider its rules, 
potentially initiating a years -long process that will delay use of the spectrum.  That outcome is 
contrary to the public interest.  In contra st, if a party values Inventory Spectrum – as Congress 
envisioned when it established the requirement to conduct spectrum auctions – it should 
participate in the eventual auction of that spectrum once the Commission’s authority to conduct 
such an auction i s restored.25/  The Commission should not entertain attempts to use what should 
be a temporary access mechanism as an end -around means to gaining permanent access to 
spectrum  for free .   
Similarly, the Bureau should not reassess in the context of this proc eeding the 
Commission’s long-standing approach to temporary spectrum use under its mobile spectrum 
holdings policies , as EchoStar proposes .26/  As noted above, commenters highlight that Inventory 
Spectrum  need only be made available on a temporary basis .  And the Commission has explicitly 
excluded temporary spectrum from its  mobile spectrum holdings policies .27/  The Commission

Spectrum.”).

"7 considers how it should apply its mobile spectrum holdings policies when it det ermines the 
service rules for spectrum that will be auctioned  and made available on a permanent basis.28/   
IV. CONCLUSION  
Commenters agree that the  most effective way to make use of Inventory Spectrum on a 
temporary basis is for the Bureau to  leverage its exi sting authority and grant access to that 
spectrum using STAs .  Alternative approaches would be slow to deploy and risk disrupting 
incumbent operations in Inventory Spectrum bands.  The Bureau should therefore act promptly 
to make Inventory Spectrum availab le by STA , which will allow consumers to benefit from 
enhanced capacity now while Congress works to restore auction authority .

REPLY COMMENTS OF ECHOSTAR  CORPORATION  
I. Introduction and Summary  
EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”) submits these reply comments in response to the 
Public Notice  seeking comment on facilitating  access to its inventory of currently unassigned 
spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions ( “Inventory 
Spectrum” ).1  The record reflects strong support for making Inventory Spectrum available for 
commercial use until Congress restores the Commission’s spectrum auction authority.  T he vast 
majority of commenters support the use of Special Temporary Authority (“STA s”) to quickly 
make the Inventory Spectrum available to a carrier that can put it to use for consumer benefit.  
But as expected, AT&T, Verizon, and T -Mobile all appear inter ested in using or maintaining 
their access  to the Inventory Spectrum.  EchoStar urges the Commission to focus on competition 
as it decides how to make this important  spectrum available to the market.

 II. The Record Reflects Strong Support for Using STAs to  Allocate Inventory 
Spectrum  
While the record reflects consensus on the importance of Congressional restoration of 
FCC auction authority, commenters generally agree that there is long Commission precedent for 
using STAs to efficiently make spectrum available .2  EchoStar agrees with AT&T that STAs can 
be a “win -win”3 for the Commission and the public , because consumers  get the benefit of more 
wireless bandwidth, yet  the Inventory Spectrum will still be available later for auction .4  
Utilizing STAs will “most closely align with the existing licensing scheme for traditionally 
auctioned spectrum”5 and it is vit al that the Inventory Spectrum should “not lie fallow”6  while 
the Commission waits for Congress to act.   In short, the record is clear that STAs  represent the 
best approach to allocating the Inventory Spectrum on a temporary basis.

 III. Inventory Spectrum Should  Support Competition, Not Harm It  
What the Commission should not do, however, is hand the Inventory Spectrum to the 
dominant incumbents, one of whom has amassed spectrum egregiously in excess of the spectrum 
screen.  The Commission has a n opportunity to bolster competition “in a manner that yields the 
most benefits to t he public”7 by making the Inventory Spectrum available to smaller and non -
dominant carriers .  As EchoStar explained,8 non-incumbent carriers (specifically, carriers other 
than AT&T, Verizon, and T -Mobile) should have a right of first refusal to all Inventory 
Spectrum.  The Commission should make this spectrum available to non-incumbent carriers 
through its STA mechanism for no fee ,9 just as it did for the dominant incumbents during 
COVID.10  The Inve ntory Spectrum should be offered on a market -wide basis for a time -period 
of at least 36 months.  Only if no non- incumbent carrier wants to or could use specific Inventory 
Spectrum should the incumbents be able to apply to use it under a six-month lease fr om the 
government upon a fee payment to the U.S. Treasury.  The Commission should also confirm that 
all Inventory Spectrum is in fact  not in use .  T-Mobile has two pending renewals to use a large 
swath e of 600 MHz Inventory Spectrum, and it is unclear if T -Mobile has continued to use that 
spectrum in spite of the expiration of the most recent STA term.11

  Offering  the Inventory Spectrum first to non -incumbent carriers  could also a ddress  
commenters’ concern that many parties could apply to use the same Invent ory Spectrum.12  
Utilizing a pro -competition, right of first refusal approach would reduce instances of mutual 
exclusivity because only the non- incumbents that need help in the form of additional spectrum 
would be among the initial applicant pool.  Removing  the incumbents from the initial applicant 
pool would minimize conflicts over the same pieces of Inventory Spectrum, even if the spectrum 
ultimately passed to the stage at which the incumbents could apply for its paid use.  
IV. Inventory Spectrum Should Be Auc tioned for Geographic Exclusive Use to Carriers 
with  an Existing Facilities -Based Presence  
EchoStar agrees with commenters that Inventory Spectrum should be made available 
under the same regulatory framework as licenses issued in the same band.13  For example, 
Inventory Spectrum in the 600 MHz band should be made available in 10 MHz blocks based on 
the Partial Economic Area ( “PEA ”) where the spectrum is located.  EchoStar also agrees with 
T-Mobile that STAs should be issued to carriers with existing wireless  facilities  in the market 
that can quickly  light up the relevant Inventory Spectrum to increase capacity and performance

 for their customers.14  Granting STAs to only those parties already providing service in a given 
area as a supplement would reduce the risk of customers coming to expect service that is only 
temporary in nature.   Doing so would also further reduce the risk of mutually exclusive  
applications.  Of course, such STAs should be subject to the pro -competition guardrails as 
proposed above  in Section III .  
While dynamic spectrum sharing and site -based licensing have many use cases, EchoStar 
agrees with several commenters that STAs are t he most efficient way to offer Inventory 
Spectrum.15  The FCC would need to create rules and database technologies for the Inventory 
Spectrum in order to avoid interference, which undermines the Commission’s stated goal to 
quickly  get Inventory Spectrum put  to use.   
V. Conclusion  
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission should put its Inventory Spectrum resources 
to work for the public interest.

REPLY COMMENTS OF ANTHONY L. JONES
I, Anthony L. Jones, respectfully submit the following reply
comments regarding other stakeholders’ views on methods with 
which the Commission could allocate presently unused spectrum 
(“Inventory Spectrum”).
I.PART 90-STYLE COORDINATION FOR NON-PART 90 NARROWBAND RADIO 
SERVICES SPECTRUM IS ALSO WELL-SUITED FOR ALLOCATING 
INVENTORY SPECTRUM
EWA broadly proposes to use frequency coordination similar 
to Part 90 for Inventory Spectrum in non-Part 90, would-be-
auctionable radio services. While I have pointed out in my 
initial comments that the Commission could effortlessly segue 
back to using the existing rules for site-based PARS licenses, I 
also see no issue with existing frequency coordinators applying 
their methods of recommending Part 90 frequency assignments for 
the PARS and other narrowband, formerly auctionable radio 
services.

comment on regulatory tools the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”)  could 
use to enable  access to its inventory of currently unassigned spectrum in bands previously 
licensed for wireless services through auctions  (“Inventory Spectrum”) .1 
I. INTRODUCTION.  
CTIA and other commenters in the record commend the Commission and urge it to 
continue to work with Congress to restore the agency’s auction authority so the most effective 
spectrum access tool at the Commission’s disposal is again available to support growing consumer, business, and enterprise demands.
2 
In the interim, there is substantial record support for the Commission making Inventory 
Spectrum available on a temporary basis through Special Temporary Authority (“STA”) authorizations.  STAs have proven effective in the past in enabling access for  a variety of users 
and could be implemented quickly so Inventory Spectrum can be put to use, consistent with the Commission’s objective in this proceeding.  
The Commission should refrain from moving forward with any proposals that would

"2 undermine the goal of making Inventory Spectrum available for near -term, licensed  use, 
including calls for importing new sharing models that would take substantial time and additional 
record support to develop.  The Commission should also disregard calls for adoption of shared access models in spectrum bands that are outside the scope of this proceeding.   II. THE RECORD SHOWS THAT SPECTRUM  AUCTIONS ARE THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PROMOTING CONTINUED WIRELESS 
LEADERSHIP . 
The record is clear that Congress should expeditiously restore the Commission’s auction 
authority.
3  Auctions remain the most efficient way of driving competition and ensuring 
commercial wireless spectrum is put to efficient use .  As CTIA highlighted, spectrum auctions 
drive market -based competition for a variety of users, promote efficient spectrum use, and  
contribute  billions  of dollars  annually to the U.S. GDP.   In addition, auction proceeds  have raised 
nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars for the U.S. Treasury, in  support of a variety of government 
programs  and the modernization of national defense systems.4   
Other commenters agree.  As  AT&T highlights , “[t]he Commission’s auction framework 
has made the United States a leader in 3G, 4G, and now 5G wireless services, unleashing 
innovation and promoting competition.”5  Moreover, as Verizon details , the Commission’s 
auction framework supports  massive investment in innovations for today’s mobile connected 
society  and for driving 5G fixed wireless access solutions that are bringing new competition to

"3 the home broadband marketplace.6  As T -Mobile notes, this investment is also bringing 
substantial benefits to America’s economy , with the U.S. wireless industry investing more than 
$309 billion into wireless networks since 2012, which rely primarily on auctioned spectrum.7  
And the Enterprise Wireless Alliance correctly notes that s pectrum auctions “ have been an 
effective, efficient means of assigning significant amounts of wireless spectrum for commercial 
use that avoid the problem of mutual exclusivity.”8 
CTIA commends the Commission for its continued work to encourage Congress to 
restore its competitive bidding authority so auctioned licenses can once again be brought to market to support these public policy objectives. III. THE EXISTING STA FRAMEWORK IS A WORKABLE VEHICLE FOR 
MAKING INVENTORY SPECTRUM AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR TERM . 
Absent auction authority, and if the Commission wants to act quickly to make Inventory 
Spectrum available, STAs are the most reasonable alternative option.
9  As commenters discuss, 
STAs will efficiently allow Inventory Spectrum to be promptly put to use, as “[t]here will be no 
need for the Commission to develop new application forms, filing processes, or technical rules .”
10 
STAs have, moreover, proven effective in providing temporary spectrum access under 
unique circumstances.  As CTIA and others discussed, the Commission has had success with the

"4 STA framework in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.11  That example demonstrates how 
effective the STA model can be in not only putting spectrum to use quickly, but also in enabling 
access to a variety of providers.12   
To that end, the Commission put out a Public Notice early in the pandemic providing 
guidance to all interested parties for obtaining STAs and relevant waivers,13 including 
specialized guidance for public safety entities.14  The relevant  docket remains an active vehicle 
for STA requests and could be used to expand STA eligibility for Inventory Spectrum.15  
Notably, STAs have been effective in putting spectrum to work by myriad providers, including:  regional providers;
16 rural providers ;17 dozens of wireless internet service providers

entities ,19 in addition to nationwide providers.  The STA framework could be similarly leveraged 
for Inventory Spectrum, providing access to a wide range of users for a variety of use cases and 
public benefits.  IV. ALTERNATIVE  PROPOSED ACCESS MODELS WOULD NOT MEET THE 
GOALS OF THE PRESENT PROCEEDING . 
Proponents of applying new shared access models to Inventory Spectrum do not solve for 
the Commission’s primary objective in this proceeding: to speed access to Inventory Spectrum while the Commission’s auction authority is lapsed.  Specifically, as the Public Notice stated, “unless and until Congress decides to restore the Commission’s auction authority, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau [] is compelled to explore how its existing regulatory tools could be used to provide the public with access to spe ctrum that would otherwise lie fallow .”
20  Shared 
access models would undermine this goal and should therefore be rejected.

"6 First, it would take time to develop both the rules and technologies for database -driven 
sharing or other coordination mechanisms for Inventory Spectrum in a manner that ensures 
protection of existing licensees in the Inventory Spectrum bands, undermining the goal of this proceeding.  Some commenters allege without  support  that existing sharing mechanisms can be 
“readily adapted” for use in the Inventory Spectrum.
21  As CTIA has pointed out , however , it 
took years for the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”)  Spectrum Access System and 
Environmental Sensing Capability operations to be developed and operative , and the 6 GHz 
Automated Frequency Coordination system operations were only recently approved to enable 
commercial standard -power Wi -Fi operations.22  Verizon further highlights that the CBRS 
sharing model and its customized tools have proven challenging to manage, “particularly given the regular operational updates that are needed for base station products and the myriad ad hoc workarounds that are be ing used to accommodate General Authorized Access  [(“GAA”)] 
grants.”
23  It would be inefficient and contrary to the principal goal of the Public Notice for the 
Commission to continue to hold the Inventory Spectrum while database tools, and rules for their usage, are developed for this spectrum. 
Second, even if an existing database mechanism could be timely and efficiently leveraged 
for Inventory Spectrum, which CTIA questions, commenters ignore the need for development of new equipment that is capable of being tethered to a coordination database.  While some 
commenters tout the purported benefits of CBRS -style sharing, they fail to provide any

"7 meaningful insight regarding the availability of devices that could operate in the Inventory 
Spectrum.24  As Blooston Rural Carriers discuss, “it is unclear how much time and resources 
would be needed to develop sensing and end user equipment needed to implement dynamic sharing.”
25  The same is true for the equipment that would need to be developed to facilitate site-
based sharing.  Thus, as  AT&T notes, “it is entirely possible that by the time this work is 
complete, the Commission’s auction authority will have resumed.”26  And, as CTIA highlighted, 
there is little incentive from a market perspective for manufacturers to invest in equipment or technologies tailored to the isolated and disconnected channels or geographic areas that comprise the Inventory Spectrum, and it would be inefficient to await standardization for new equipment.
27 
Rather than addressing the problem at hand, supporters of shared access in the Inventory 
Spectrum are merely seeking a foothold for expanding a framework that has otherwise not yet borne out from an investment or deployment perspective.
28  As CTIA has demonstrated, 
evidence continues to show limited investment and deployment in complex shared spectrum-based offerings, and the cable industry has acknowledged that shared- use frameworks like CBRS 
cannot be relied on to deliver the wide -area coverage needed to help  bridge the digital divide.

acknowledged known challenges with the CBRS framework.32  
Even as NCTA supports restoration of the Commission’s  auction authority and states that 
the “authority to auction spectrum is critical for the Commission ,”33 it asks the Commission to 
“consider and prioritize coexistence -based spectrum access frameworks in all proceedings that 
propose to make new commercial spectrum available.”34  Tellingly, NCTA then focuses its filing 
on urging the Commission to adopt sharing models for spectrum bands that are wholly outside this proceeding and, indeed, currently not adapted for commercial wireless use —specifically, the 
3.1-3.45 GHz, 7.125-8.4 GHz, 12.7-13.25 GHz, and 37.0-37.6 GHz bands.

"9 Other proposals likewise would undermine the basic principles of this inquiry.  For 
example, s everal proposals would likely require further Commission evaluation, including 
potentially a rulemaking proceeding.  This includes, for instance, establishing database 
coordination requirements and interference protection criteria for any shared framework that is  
applied to a band that is already licensed for full -power, flexible -rights use and with rights to 
interference protection .  Calls to change the rules for the STA framework36 or to import a 
potentially permanent GAA model to Inventory Spectrum37 would likewise require a fulsome 
public record .  Such evaluations  would take significant time, further delaying access to Inventory 
Spectrum.  As T -Mobile states, “[s]olutions that will take years to develop are no solutions at all 
because the [Commission’s]  spectrum auction authority will likely be restored before they can be 
implemented.”38 
Additionally, several proposals  would have the Commission adopt rules for Inventory 
Spectrum that would create access rights that most likely would exceed the timeframe of the  
auction authority lapse.39  This, too, would undermine  the goal of providing a temporary access 
model until competitive bidding authority is restored.  
Finally , commenters indicate that enabling a leasing mechanism for Inventory Spectrum 
raises a variety of questions and concerns, including regarding its administration and pricing

"10 structure .40  Additionally, as Verizon notes, leasing Inventory Spectrum “would pose 
complicated legal questions as no licensees hold the Inventory Spectrum to lease it under 
Commission rules, and there may be legal hurdles to the FCC leasing spectrum to users without statutory authority.”
41  The Commission would need to consider these questions before 
implementing a leasing proposal.  V. CONCLUSION.  
As the Public Notice makes clear, the  goal of this proceeding is to find solutions for 
making Inventory Spectrum available while the Commission’s auction authority is lapsed .  This 
necessitates a workable, temporary access framework.  The Commission’s existing STA model can serve this purpose on an interim basis until the agency’s auction authority is restored and the Inventory Spectrum can be made available through competitive bidding.

OF THE  
NATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS COUNCIL  
 
The National Wireless Communications Council (“NWCC”) respectfully submits its 
Reply Comments in response to the Public Notice of the Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau (“WTB”) of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regarding the FCC’s 
expired auction authority.1  In the absence of Congressional action to reinstate that authority, 
the WTB has requested comments on how available regulatory tools such as dynamic 
spectrum sharing, non- exclusive site -based licensing, spectrum leasing, and special temporary 
authorizations (“STAs”) could be used to make inventory spectrum held by the FCC available to eligible entities while avoiding the submission of mutually exclusive applications.  
The NWCC is a non -profit association of organizations representing virtually all users 
of land mobile radio systems, providers of land mobile services, and manufacturers of land

 mobile radio equipment.  These include all FCC -certified Frequency Advisory Committees 
(“FACs”).2   
The users represented by NWCC members have particular interest in narrowband and 
wideband spectrum allocations such as Part 22 VHF/UHF paging, Part 90 220 MHz and 800 
MHz SMR, Part 80 AMTS, and Part 95 218- 219 MH z.  The auctioned spectrum in these 
bands is used in systems around the count ry that provide essential communications 
capabilities for public safety, critical infrastructure, industrial, and commercial dispatch services  – the private land mobile radio (“PLMR”) services .  Because of their limited 
bandwidths, the licenses in these bands  have not generated significant auction revenue by 
comparison with broadband allocations used to provide commercial service to the consumer marketplace.   However, they can be an important component in  wireless systems that serve 
other publicly vital uses.   Some licenses in these services, like those in certain broadband 
allocations, were not acquired at auction or have been recovered by the FCC and thereby constitute “inventory spectrum .”  The NWCC supports the recommendations of commenters 
in this proceeding that have proposed auction alternatives that would enable PLMR entities to 
put this spectrum into productive use without creating situations of mutual exclusivity.  
EWA reco mmended that certified FACs could assume their traditional r ole of 
coordinat ing applications  prior to submission to the FCC, thereby avoiding instances of 
mutual exclusivity.  EWA recommended this approach in the bands referenced above, as well 
as other narrowband/wideband spectrum that might be identified by the FCC.  It suggested

 that exclusive licenses be granted on a county basis rather than the larger geographic areas for 
which spectrum in those bands was auctioned although, as discussed below, both county and 
exclusive site -based licenses could be accommodated  in the proposed approach.  While the 
Public Notice identified non- exclusive site -based licenses as an option, the NWCC questions 
whether the historical party -line, shared channel r egulatory approach would attract 
meaningful interest from the PLMR community or any prospective licensees.  Current 
technology is based primarily on exclusive rights to spectrum within a geographic area, including when defined as Part 90 FB8 protected contours.   Coordinating the use of spectrum 
by monitoring before transmitting or other mechanisms that limit access to a licensee’s own channels has an adverse impact  on spectrum utilization  and has little utility in today’s digital 
PLMR systems.  
The NWCC recognizes that exclusivity rights inherently create the potential for 
mutual exclusivity, particularly when there is a date certain when applications can be 
submitted  to the FCC .  The Part 90 FACs have addressed this situation successfully in 
multiple instances through the queueing process described in EWA’s Comments.  Entities  
submit their applications to FACs who review them to ensure completeness and compliance with FCC requirements.  On a date and time  certain, FACs send the applications to a third 
party that creates a time- stamped receipt queue that determines in what order the applications 
can be assigned channels by their FACs who then share that information so all FACs know 
what channels are available for subsequent applications .  This approach has been tested and 
has allowed the licensing of exclusive site -based systems in multiple Part 90 bands with no",2,NWCC Replies- WT 24-72 - 4-22-24.pdf,NWCC - The National Wireless Communications Council,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 mutually exclusive applications submitted to the FCC.3  It would work equally effectively in 
the other narrowband/wideband allocations where licenses previously were awarded by 
auction.4 
EWA proposed that licenses be issued on a county- by-county basis.  While that 
approach has the advantage of simplicity, NWCC recommends that licenses be available on a county and/or site -specific basis.  The Comments filed by the Blooston Rural Carriers 
(“BRC”) recommended contour -protected, site-based licensing managed by third -party 
coordinators , using the Part 90 FACs as an example.
5  The NWCC recognizes that site- based 
licenses may fit the requirements of certain applicants and could result in issuance of a larger number of licenses.  The third -party queuing process described above can handle both types 
of applications , since FACs are capable of reviewing the proposed parameters of both types of 
systems and coordinating channels on a n exclusive  site-based and/or  county basis and 
ensuring no contour overlap between and among them.   
The NWCC strongly endorses EWA’s recommendation that the FAC coordination 
process described herein for the identified narrowband/wideband allocations be used to assign inventory spectrum in those bands even after the FCC’s auction authority has been reinstated.  
The FCC already has a backlog of broadband spectrum for auction ing.  That backlog, 
including broadband i nventory spectrum, likely will have increased by the time it can begin 
conducting auctions.  It is uncertain when, if ever, the FCC will have an opportunity to 
auction inventory spectrum in the bands needed by NWCC members.  It has been more than a 
 
3 The FACs worked collaboratively to establish limits on the number of channels that could be requested in a 
single application and the number of applications an entity could file in a geographic area.  These agreed upon 
parameters promoted a broader distribution of spectrum and discouraged speculative applications.  
4 Each of these bands was available for site- based licensing before the FCC was granted auction authority.  
Overlay auction licenses are required to protect incumbent site- based systems.  
5 The BRC Comments do not specify particular bands in which they recommend the use of this approach so 
presumably the recommendation covers all auctioned spectrum, including broadband allocations.",3,NWCC Replies- WT 24-72 - 4-22-24.pdf,NWCC - The National Wireless Communications Council,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 decade since it has done so , and the demand for broadband spectrum continues to escalate.   
The FCC’s auction authority is expressly not tied to revenue generation but, even if it were, 
the revenue that would be generated by auctioning this narrowband/wideband spectrum is 
sufficiently nominal to be of no concern.  The public will be better served by allowing 
spectrum that has remained unused for well over a decade to be placed into productive operation pursuant to the licensing approach proposed herein.  If the FCC nonetheless determines it must revert to spectrum auctions  once it has authority to conduct them, the 
NWCC endorses the BRC position.  Site - or county- based licenses issued in the interim must 
receive protection from overlay auction licenses , and such incumbents should be awarded 
bidding credits toward purchasing those overlay licenses.

REPLY COMMENTS OF VERIZON  
The record in this proceeding makes clear that auctions remain the ideal model for 
assigning exclusive -use, licensed spectrum  so vital to Americans’ connectivity , as Congress 
determined in enacting Section 309(j) of the Communications Act.   As the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau (“Bureau”) considers ways to enable access to the inventory of 
unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed through auctions (“Inventory Spectrum”),1 it 
should bear in mind that the lapse in the Commission’s auction authority is both temporary and 
extraordinary, and there is “little doubt that it will be restored.”2  The Commission should avoid 
any actions that might undermine the primacy of auctions in assigning  commercial spectrum or 
impair its ability to auction that spectrum once auction authority is restored.  
The Commission should not introduce other spectrum access licensing frameworks —
such as dynamic spectrum sharing or site -based licensing —into bands that are already licensed

"2 for exclusive, flexible -use operations.3  Instead, the Commission should rely on its existing 
special temporary authority (“STA”) to enable temporary access to Inventory Spectrum until 
auction authority is restored and the Inventory Spectrum can be auctioned.  In doing so, the 
Commission should forcefully reject EchoStar’s discriminatory and anticompetitive proposals.  
I. STA S ARE THE BEST OPTION TO MAKE INVENTORY SPECTRUM AVAILABLE 
PROMPTLY WHILE PRESERVING THESE CRITICAL BANDS FOR FUTURE AUCTION .   
The record confirms that the Commission should rely on its special temporary authority 
in Section 1.931 to grant access to Inventory Spectrum licenses on a temporary basis.4  The lapse 
in the Commission’s auction authority is an extraordinary circumstance, and grant of STAs will 
provide immediate, temporary access to “entities that are able and motivated to rapidly put the 
spectrum to use for the benefit of wireless users.” 5  At the same time, STAs will preserve the 
opportunity to auction that spectrum at a later date to ensure that it is ultimately assigned  to the 
party that values it most highly.  
Commenters agree that it makes sense for the Commission to establish an orderly 
application process for these STAs.6  The Bureau could establish an initial limited filing window 
during which applicants may submit applications for STA s to use Inventory Spectrum.7  To the 
extent that mutually exclusive applications are filed, applicants should be provided a limited

execute in the near term.”) (“CTIA Comments”).

"3 settlement period to resolve mutual exclusivity and required to negotiate in good faith.8  If 
mutually exclusive applications cannot be resolved through good -faith negotiations, the spectrum 
should be held in inventory until it can be auctioned.  The Bureau could open periodic additional 
STA application windows if auction authority remains lap sed. 
The Commission should also require that Inventory Spectrum made available by STA be 
put into use promptly and should condition renewal of any STA on compliance with the 
performance requirements for licenses in the relevant service.9  These actions are critical to 
ensure that “consumers get access to the spectrum with minimal delay.”10 STA holders should be 
subject to the same service and technical rules that apply to the spectrum band to which they 
seek access.11  And STAs —which enable only temporary service —should not impact the 
Commission’s mobile spectrum holdings analysis.12 
Once the Commission’s auction authority is restored and Inventory Spectrum is 
reauctioned, the Commission should ensure that authorized holders of STAs, if they are not the 
winning bidders for the spectrum, transition off the STA frequencies in a timely ma nner so that 
the winning bidder can promptly access the frequencies .  If the winning bidder has an STA to

11 Calls to modify the existing rules in these bands should be rejected.  For example, EWA’s proposal 
“that the geographic licensing scheme in each band be modified to provide for assignment by county,” is 
out of scope and the Commission should disregard it.   Comments of Enterprise Wireless Alliance 
(“EWA”), WT Docket No. 24 -72, at 4 (filed Apr. 8, 2024).  As CTIA observes, “enact[ing] changes to the 
underlying service or technical rules of any impacted spectrum bands … would be a legally vulnerable 
infringem ent on existing licensees’ rights, disrupt and fragment the existing spectrum environment, 
undermine investment, and introduce the potential for harmful interference to existing co - and adjacent -
band licensees.” CTIA Comments at 8. Such changes would also delay access to and deployment of the 
Inventory Spectrum .

"4 operate on the spectrum that it won, however, that STA holder should be permitted to continue 
operating pursuant to STA until its licenses are issued.13 
The Commission should roundly reject EchoStar’s discriminatory proposals that target 
particular providers .  Among other things, EchoStar suggests that “every carrier other than 
AT&T, T -Mobile, and Verizon” should get a right -of-first refusal to apply for STAs  for free , and 
those STAs should last for at least 36 months.14  In contrast, EchoStar suggests that AT&T, T -
Mobile, and Verizon should be able to access Inventory Spectrum only through a “six -month 
lease from the government, with a fee.”15  These self -serving proposals are not only blatantly 
anticompetitive, they are not permitted under the Communications Act.16  Further, the 
Commission has explained that “ restricting eligibility for licenses without adequate justification 
could harm the public interest,” and excluding categories of potential licensees “risk[s] reducing 
the likelihood that the party valuing the license the most will win the license and put i t to use for 
the benefit of the public.”17  So too, restricting particular providers  from applying for STAs for 
spectrum that will ultimately be reauctioned is not in the public interest.

hurdles that would need to be addressed before such a mechanism could be put in place.  See, e.g. , T-

"5 II. DYNAMIC SPECTRUM SHARING AND SITE-BASED LICENSING FRAMEWORKS WOULD 
NOT RESULT IN PROMPT DEPLOYMENT OF INVENTORY SPECTRUM AND ARE NOT IN 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST . 
The record is clear: dynamic spectrum sharing and site -based licensing are not feasible in 
any reasonable period of time, nor do they represent the optimal use of Inventory Spectrum.   
First, as commenters note, both options require the development of new technical rules, 
processes, equipment, and/or systems.  Permitting access through these processes would take 
extensive time to implement,18 and it is likely the Commission’s auction authority will be 
restored before these mechanisms could be put into place.  This is not greenfield spectrum but 
rather spectrum bands with established rules and mature equipment ecosystems.  Further,  
“complex sharing frameworks have not proven effective in promoting investment or 
deployment,” and there is no reason to expect that “applying a specialized sharing mechanism in 
isolated and disconnected channels or geographic areas that are in a band alread y licensed” 
would be practical from an economic and deployment perspective.19  Not only are the shared -
spectrum proposals impractical, if adopted, they would ultimately decrease the value of 
Inventory Spectrum at auction —leading to more spectrum potentially lying fallow.20  Those 
commenters supporting sharing frameworks for Inventory Spectrum do not explain how these 
 
18 See, e.g. , Comments of Blooston, WT Docket No. 24 -72, at 4 (“[T]he process of identifying and 
approving dynamic frequency coordinators would take significant time.  Also, it is unclear how much 
time and resources would be needed to develop sensing and end user equi pment needed to implement 
dynamic sharing[.]”) (“Blooston Comments”); Verizon Comments; AT&T Comments at 7 -8; CTIA 
Comments at 8 -10; T -Mobile Comments at 8 -10.

20 For example, Blooston suggests that future auction winners be granted overlay licenses that must 
protect any site -based licenses granted while the Commission lacks auction authority.  Blooston 
Comments at 2.  Such a process could lead to more spectrum lyi ng fallow because prospective auction 
participants may not highly value spectrum licenses subject to such encumbrances.",4,Verizon Inventory Spectrum PN Reply Comments (4.22.24).pdf,VERIZON,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"6 frameworks overcome the above shortcomings ,21 and the Commission should refrain from 
adopting them.   
Finally, several commenters used their comments to support sharing frameworks in bands 
that are  not Inventory Spectrum, such as the Lower 3 GHz band, 7/8 GHz band, Lower 37 GHz 
band, and 12.7 GHz band.22  The Commission should dismiss those comments, as those bands 
are subject to processes governed by the National Spectrum Strategy and/or other rulemakings.  
This proceeding is not the proper venue to discuss those bands.  
III. CONCLUSION . 
It is commendable that the Bureau is exploring mechanisms to make Inventory Spectrum 
available to the public.  The record lays bare that the only reasonable solution to ensure that 
Inventory Spectrum is promptly put into service is through the Commission’s existing STA 
authority.

REPLY COMMENTS OF COMPETITIVE CARRIERS ASSOCIATION  
Competitive Carriers Association (“CCA”)1 respectfully submits these reply comments in 
response to the FCC’s Public Notice on potential options for facilitating access to unassigned 
auction inventory spectrum (“Inventory Spectrum”) given the extended lapse of FCC spectrum 
auction authority from Congress.2  The Public Notice  seeks comment on how the FCC  “could 
use its current statutory authority to provide the public with access to its inventory of currently 
unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions” 
including potentially via means such as “(1) providing acce ss through dynamic spectrum sharing 
techniques; (2) providing access through non -exclusive site -based licensing; and (3) leasing 
spectrum inventory licenses.”3

        It is critical for Congress to renew the FCC’s  authority to auction spectrum.  CCA and 
many other stakeholders alongside the FCC have been strongly urging Congress to reinstate the 
FCC’s spectrum auction authority and restart a long -term spectrum pipeline to identify, study, 
and make available additional spectrum for licensed commerc ial use.  FCC spectrum auctions are 
in large part responsible for the robust wireless networks we have today, contributing to U.S. 
leadership in mobile broadband innovati on.  Regardless of other potential avenues to make 
spectrum available for commercial use, a return to a robust auction regime is the best way to 
promote meaningful and sustainable commercial wireless growth .   
In the meantime, commercial wireless carriers throughout the country are challenged in 
terms of expanding and updating their networks to meet insatiable consumer demands, and the 
United States is falling behind globally with regard to innovation and levera ging new 
technologies for economic growth.  CCA  therefore shares  the record’s appreciation for the 
FCC’s creativity and commitment to considering ways to make additional spectrum available for 
commercial use during the extended lapse of spectrum auction au thority.  Inventory S pectrum 
would likely be in high demand at auction for commercial use and is not best serving the public 
interest while being unused.  However, CCA shares the concerns of many who comment  the 
Public Notice’s proposals are insufficient to provide the clarity and certainty wireless providers 
need to meaningfully  deploy  on the Inventory S pectrum.  In the absence of auction authority, it is 
important that any actions the FCC takes reflect industry’s  need for the certainty provided by full 
power spectrum use combined with protection from interference.   
I. CERTAINTY FOR COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL WIRELESS PROVIDERS 
IS KEY TO ANY ALTERNATIVE SPECTRUM ACCESS METHODS  
While many in the record noted their appreciation for  the Public Notice’s  proposals to 
make Inventory Spectrum  available, there is a common concern that the proposals do not provide",1,CCA Spectrum Inventory Reply Comments_4-22-24.pdf,COMPETITIVE CARRIERS ASSOCIATION,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"3 
 sufficient certainty.4  Certainty is also a  key factor to CCA members in terms of whether and 
how useful any Inventory Spectrum  alternative access solutions will be for their networks and 
serving their customers.  CCA encourages the FCC, therefore, to consider the ability to provide 
the highest possible degree of certainty to potential users of the Inventory Spectrum  as it moves 
forward with its consideration of various alternatives.  Certainty in terms of duration, use, and  
lack of harmful  interference are key considerations in generating sufficient interest to use 
Inventory Spectrum  for commercial deployment s and facilitating carriers’ business decision s to 
invest in additional network equipment , as well as  to avoid potentially stranding capital in 
network equipment .   
Duration of alternative solutions.   First, certainty is needed with respect to the 
expectation of the ability to use the Inventory Spectrum  for a sufficient duration to justify 
investments needed to deploy service on the spectrum .  It is unclear from the Public Notice if the 
FCC’s intent is to make the Inventory Spectrum  available via alternative means as a temporary 
solution only until auction authority is reinstated, until auction of the Inventory Spectrum  
eventually occurs and is completed, or if the int ent is to take the Inventory Spectrum  out of the 
purview of future auctions altogether.  The initial comments in the record suggest that others 
share CCA’s views.5  Clarity will help carriers determine whether the Inventory Spectrum  can 
 
4 See, e.g.,  Comments of the Blooston Rural Carriers, WT Docket No. 24 -72 at 5 (filed April 8, 
2024) (“Without the certainty of an exclusive use license, rural operators would be reluctant to 
make the significant investments needed to expand their networks and services  into new and 
unserved/underserved areas.”) (“Blooston Rural Carriers Comments”); Comments of Edison 
Electric Institute, Utilities Technology Council, Utility Broadband Alliance, FirstEnergy Corp., 
Southern California Eison, and Southern Company Services, Inc., WT Docket No. 24 -72 at 4

the certainty needed to incentivize investment and robust use of Inventory Spectrum.”).  
5 See, e.g.,  Blooston Rural Carriers Comments at 2 (urging the FCC “to be clear about what will 
happen to shared and/or non -exclusive operations if and when the FCC’s auction authority is 
restored” and to adopt overlay licensing when/if the Inventory Spectrum is auctioned);",2,CCA Spectrum Inventory Reply Comments_4-22-24.pdf,COMPETITIVE CARRIERS ASSOCIATION,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"4 
 meaningfully benefit their customers , and certainty of an extended usage  term could  better  
incentivize longer -term investments in rural and remote areas .   
To be a meaningful and useful alternative to auctioned, licensed spectrum, CCA members 
need a high degree of certainty that the spectrum will be available and useful for a sufficient 
duration to warrant the significant investment potentially needed to deploy service on the 
spectrum.   Making the 600  MHz and AWS -3 spectrum available , for example, will  probably 
primarily  benefit carriers who already have those bands in their networks and can easily 
incorporate it without significant equipment investment.  The spectrum is likely too widely 
scattered in its availability otherwise  unless there is significant certainty regarding the ability to 
use the spectrum longer -term to justify additional investments that would be needed by many 
carriers . 
The primary need for additional spectrum from CCA  member s’ perspective is for long -
term investment for expanding networks, upgrading networks, and providing new services and 
innovative applications to consumers.   CCA members would prefer outcomes that provide 
longer-term certainty with regard to spectrum authorizations  (e.g., license or authorization 
periods generally associated with spectrum licensed via auctions) .  As Blooston Rural Carriers 
commented, to “promote meaningful investment in rural services, the Commission needs to 
provide a way for entrepreneurs and small business operators in rural markets earn exclusive 
rights on Inventory Spectrum channels in rural areas where they have spent the time, money and 
effort to construct facilities and provide s ervice to customers.”6

"5 
 In the absence of long -term availability of the Inventory Spectrum , the use of 
mechanisms such as Special Temporary Authority (“STAs”) could potentially be effective and 
useful to commercial wireless providers as “band -aid” solutions for short -term capacity needs or 
interim solutions to meet consumer needs  until spectrum auction authority is reinstated and the 
spectrum is auctioned .  In the recent past, for example, the FCC utilized STAs with success to 
help meet spectrum needs during the COVID -19 pandemic.  The record supports the use of 
STAs , especially if  STAs “closely  align with the existing licensing for traditionally auction 
spectrum”7 and allow providers to easily and rapidly supplement their networks.8  CTIA notes 
that that “STAs can be beneficial for nic he and temporary use cases and might present a 
framework for enabling near -term access to otherwise fallow Inventory Spectrum while the 
Commission awaits authority to auction these frequencies.”9   
 Use considerations.   CCA joins those in the record who encourage the FCC to seek 
solutions that prioritize licensed commercial wireless uses.  There is significant  need for 
additional spectrum to meet consumer demand for mobile broadband and 5G deployments.   The 
FCC should strive to use the Inventory Spectrum  to meet these needs to the fullest extent 
possible.  This is particularly important if the FCC is intending the Inventory Spectrum  to not be 
auctioned when Congressional authority is reinstated.   The use of site -based licensing or leasing 
of some sort may be the most feasible alternatives in terms of providing the certainty CCA 
members —many of whom are small and rural carriers —would need to potentially deploy new 
and expanded services on the Inventory Spectrum .  As the Blooston Rural Carriers note, site -

 based licensing could be implemented quickly, “allowing smaller service providers in rural areas 
to gain access to higher power licensed spectrum bands.  Access to licensed high -power 
spectrum is particularly important for carriers that wish to use wireless facilities to support 
Broadband Equity, Acce ss, and Deployment (BEAD) Program buildouts to unserved and 
underserved areas.”10  However, as the Blooston Rural Carriers also note, these site -based 
licenses should  be made available on an exclusive basis —“[o]therwise, investment in a wireless 
system operating in what is often difficult terrain and lower population density will be 
discouraged, and Inventory Spectrum will remain unused.”11  The Inventory Spectrum should not 
be allocated and distributed  to other users or uses (e.g., unlicensed use) due to eas e of 
administration when the spectrum would have otherwise gone to licensed, exclusive use had 
auctions been possible.    
 CCA also appreciates the comment from EchoStar that Inventory Spectrum should be 
deployed if possible in ways that promote competition.12 In addition to the comments above  
about the need for certainty regarding duration and adequate protections against harmful 
interference , utilizing Inventory Spectrum to promote service by competitive carriers, 
particularly in rural areas, could advance  the FCC’s competition policy objectives and facilitate  
wireless deployment in rural areas.   The Blooston Rural Carriers share a similar view regarding 
the potential for Inventory Spectrum to advance and incentivize network buildout in rural areas 
and greater opportunities for small businesses.13

 Interference considerations.   CCA members also urge the FCC to consider alternatives 
for the Inventory Spectrum that reduce the chances of  harmful interference.  Clear and certain 
frameworks aimed at protecting mobile terrestrial services will create the conditions  needed to 
work towards deploying services on Inventory Spectrum.  Absent that degree of certainty  
regarding protection from harmful interference , the ability to use Inventory Spectrum  for a short 
period of time, potentially without sufficient assurances that it will remain available and be free 
from harmful interference, will likely be of significantly limited value to CCA carrier members.  
The risk of harmful interference makes it less likely that carriers will commit to the necessary 
investments needed to deploy on the spectrum given the likelihood of network functionality and 
consumer quality concerns.   
More specifically, CCA joins commenters in the record in discouraging  the FCC from 
utilizing sharing regimes on the Inventory Spectrum .  The primary sharing regimes currently in 
use—the 3.5 GHz CBRS SAS approach and the 6 GHz AFC approach —have shortcomings that 
would not translate well into the Inventory Spectrum  scenario, particularly in terms of 
interference avoidance and the ability to quickly implement service on the Inventory Spectrum  
bands.  Verizon , for example,  notes that the sharing model in CBRS has “proven challenging to 
manage” and that “[s ]pectrum sharing frameworks . . . do not enable the assured access to wide -
area capability that is fundamental to full -fledged wireless service.”14  T-Mobile also discourages 
“implementing complex spectrum access regimes such as dynamic spectrum sharing” due to

 experience, CCA members have enduring concerns regarding the shortcomings of the prevalent  
approach es to sharing .  They have experienced issues with maintaining reliable, consistent, 
uninterrupted communications  under sharing approaches and would likely have significantly 
reduced interest in utilizing Inventory Spectrum  under those same unsatisfactory conditions.  
Utilizing a different or new sharing scenario on the Inventory Spectrum  would raise many 
questions, including how much time and resources “would be needed to develop sensing and end 
user equipment needed to implement dynamic sharing, and who would be responsible for these 
additional costs.”16  A sharing regime would  take a significant amount of time to develop and to 
effectively implement, likely making such an alternative infeasible in terms of making Inventory 
Spectrum  available in the near term “and would be contrary to the public interest.”17   
*  *  * 
CCA appreciates the  FCC considering possible alternatives to auctions for making 
Inventory Spectrum  available for beneficial use.  CCA realizes that, in order to gain the certainty 
needed to deploy commercial wireless broadband networks, suboptimal and administratively 
burdensome procedures may potentially be needed to resolve mutual exclusivity issues and 
create optimal technical and  business conditions for facilitating the deployment of advanced 
wireless services in areas that need it most.  These process es, however, will more likely lead to 
meaningful long -term use of the spectrum, particularly in the rural areas that many CCA 
members serve.   CCA urges the  FCC to strive for maximum certainty in any alternatives it 
pursues .

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
Prompt restoration of the Federal Communications Commission’s (“Commission”) 
auction authority is of critical importance.  Comments make clea r that sound policy also requires 
the use of diverse spectrum access frameworks to foster innovation and competition domestically and globally, not over-reliance on the license d-exclusive approach  favored by the few 
nationwide wireless carriers.  Coexistence frame works in particular o ffer a possible mechanism 
for utilizing the inventory of una ssigned spectrum described in the Public Notice (“inventory 
spectrum”).  As NCTA has explained,  prioritizing coexistence frameworks wherever  doing so is 
feasible is pivotal in ensuri ng that the U.S. maintains its global technological and economic 
leadership and keeps pace with American c onsumers’ demands, desp ite scarce greenfield 
spectrum.  Other commenters agree that coexis tence frameworks are e ssential for efficient 
spectrum use.

"2 To promote innovation and U.S. leadership in wireless tec hnologies, NCTA encourages 
the Commission to account for th e increasingly tailored ways in  which consumers, industries, 
and institutions use spectrum.  The evidence of th is evolution is powerful: a significant majority 
of mobile traffic runs on Wi-F i, myriad entities rely on privat e networks using licensed-shared 
spectrum, and the vast majority of wireless data use occurs indoors, where Wi-Fi enables 
efficient sharing and use am ong many users and devices. 
For all of these reasons, NCTA encourages the Commission to prioritize coexistence-
based spectrum access frameworks wherever feasible  and to adopt such frameworks as promptly 
as possible in the Lower 3 GHz, 7 GHz, Lowe r 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands, which are ripe for 
action and can deliver signi ficant near-term benefits.2 
I. COEXISTENCE-BASED SPECTRUM ACCESS FRAMEWORKS MAXIMIZE 
EFFICIENT SPECTRUM USE AND AR E ESSENTIAL TO COMPETITION AND 
INNOVATION. 
Commenters agree that robust use of coexis tence-based spectrum access frameworks like 
unlicensed and licensed-shared advance U.S. spectrum priorities by making the most efficient 
use possible of this “v ital national resource.”3 
A. Other commenters agree that coexistenc e-based spectrum access frameworks 
like licensed-shared and unlicensed serv e the public interest by maximizing 
efficient spectrum use. 
As NCTA has explained, the Commission’s r obust use of unlicense d and licensed-shared 
spectrum access frameworks wherever feasible w ill maximize the benefits of next-generation 
connectivity for the greatest nu mber of users by allowing econo mic growth and innovative use

"3 cases to flourish.4  Other commenters agree.  For exam ple, the New America Open Technology 
Institute and Public Knowledge (“OTI and PK ”) explain that “a fr amework premised on 
coordinated sharing, licensing by rule, relatively lower power lim its and automated database 
coordination can be implemented quickly a nd will best serve the public interest.”5  The Dynamic 
Spectrum Alliance similarly observe s that “[a]s the Commission looks  to solve challenges with 
the deployment of advanced wire less services across the country and ensure valuable spectrum is 
not sitting fallow, dynamic shared  access can enable higher-capaci ty and lower-cost deployments 
in both urban and rural underserved areas and stre amline access to spectrum that has been under-
utilized.”6  Given that American cons umers rely on Wi-Fi for a large majority of their mobile 
traffic, and that billions of connected home, he althcare, educational, manufacturing, and other 
devices rely on bespoke private 5G se rvices, often using shared spectrum,7 coexistence 
frameworks are necessary to enable rapid spectr um access for a diverse array of users and use 
cases. 
Commenters observe that the technologies that support coexistence in the Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) and 6 GHz bands have implications beyond those bands, 
too.  The Commission and industry can leverage in sights gained in the development of those 
technologies to more quickly implement shari ng systems in other bands, including, potentially,

"4 bands in which inventory spectrum is located.8  As explained in NCTA ’s opening comments, the 
Commission should replicate the success of the CBRS and 6 GHz bands by adopting coexistence-based spectrum access frameworks as promptly as possible in the Lower 3 GHz, 7 
GHz, Lower 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands, which are ripe for such action.
9  American businesses 
and consumers, and U.S. technological and econ omic leadership and competitiveness, would 
benefit as a result. 
B. The record confirms that coexistence-based spectrum access frameworks are 
essential to competition and innovation. 
Commenters agree with NCTA that coex istence-based spectrum access frameworks 
enable competition and innovation in the U.S. and globally.10  Federated Wireless highlights 
CBRS-style sharing as a “shining example of how spectrum resources  can be made available in a 
cost-effective and efficient manner while pr omoting both commercial  consumer-oriented 
services and a proliferation of private wireless networks for a wide variety of industrial and 
social use cases.”11  Other countries have taken note of this example and sought  to replicate the 
success of American innovations in coexistence technologies.  OTI and PK  note that regulators 
 
8 OTI/PK, DSA, and WISPA suggest that Spectr um Access System and/or Automated Frequency 
Coordination technologies coul d be tailored to operate in  the inventory spectrum.  See, e.g., 
OTI/PK Comments at 4 (“One or more of the existing frequency coordi nation systems already 
certified to manage spectrum sh aring in the CBRS and/or 6 GHz ba nds can be authorized to both 
register and optimize shared access [in the inve ntory spectrum].”); Comments of WISPA – The 
Association for Broadband Wit hout Boundaries at 3-4, WT Do cket No. 24-72 (filed Apr. 8, 
2024) (“WISPA Comments”) (arguing that a coexistence regime is  possible in the inventory 
spectrum and the rules and proce sses for 6 GHz, adjusted as a ppropriate, could enable rapid 
access to that spectrum); see DSA  Comments at 3 (stating that the “experience gained from [the 
TV White Space, CBRS, and 6 GHz bands] can be tail ored to meet the specific opportunities and 
challenges of putting Inventory Spectrum to use . . .”).

"5 in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and more than a dozen other nations have 
successfully adopted CBRS-style sharing frameworks.12  As NCTA has explained, the 
Commission’s use of diverse coexistence-based frameworks wherever feasible fuels innovation 
and competition domestically and allows American  innovation in coexistence technologies to 
flourish globally.13 
II. EXCLUSIVE LICENSING RESULTS IN INEFFICIENT AND INEQUITABLE 
SPECTRUM ACCESS AS COMPARED TO COEXISTENCE FRAMEWORKS. 
Some commenters claim that large-area, high- power, licensed-exclusive frameworks: (A) 
facilitate rapid and efficient sp ectrum use; (B) reinforce U.S. technological leadership; and (C) 
generate greater economic valu e than do coexistence-based fr ameworks.  Each of these 
assertions lacks merit. 
A. Coexistence-based frameworks can ensure that spectrum is put to use rapidly 
by eliminating the need to clear incumb ents and reducing barriers to entry. 
Although the Commission’s ability to conduct aucti ons still plays a vital role in enabling 
commercial spectrum access, prioritizing auctions of large-area, high-powe r, licensed-exclusive 
spectrum does not ensure efficient spectrum use, as demonstrated by the fallow spectrum at the 
heart of the Public Notice .  This proceeding arises in pa rt because geographic-area based, 
licensed-exclusive spectrum either went unsold at auction or was returned to the Commission 
after license issuance.14  Auctions that feature such li censed-exclusive spectrum may enhance 
incumbent carriers’ nationwide c overage, but they do not create opportunities for new entrants 
and innovators.15

"6 Nationwide wireless carriers and other comm enters complain that coexistence-based 
frameworks are too complex and take too long to implement.16  As an initial matter, those 
commenters fail to acknowledge their own effort s to hamper the development of new unlicensed 
ecosystems and delay the implementa tion of novel sharing frameworks.17  Moreover, in the 
CBRS band, commercial deployment of the nove l Spectrum Access System framework took 
place a mere two years after CBRS rules were finalized in 2018,18 an impressive feat by any 
metric, especially consideri ng this brand-new technology was developed collaboratively among 
industry and government stakeholders.  The ma rketplace for CBRS serv ices and devices has 
flourished and continues to grow, with ove r 300,000 CBRS base-station devices deployed –

"7 industry in over forty years.19  The technological advancements  realized in the CBRS band will 
enable faster deployment in futu re bands modeled on this successf ul licensed-shared framework. 
The Commission’s decision to open the enti re 6 GHz band to unlicensed Wi-Fi use 
likewise has been a resounding succ ess, and the band has grown “near ly twice as fast as the 5 
GHz band.”20  With the Commission’s recent approva l of several entities as Automated 
Frequency Coordination  system operators,21 use of the 6 GHz band will quickly become even 
more robust as standard power Wi-F i operations commence indoors and outdoors.22 
Nationwide wireless carriers also claim that special temporary authority (“STA”) 
employing license structures and technical rules that apply to li censed-exclusive spectrum in the 
bands where the inventory spectrum is located would offer rapid and uncomplicated access to 
inventory spectrum,23 but this approach is unsuita ble in at least two ways.  First , carriers offer no 
reason to expect that an STA a pproach could be implemented mo re quickly than a coexistence-

"8 period is required to resolve mutually exclusive applications.24  Furthermore, if failure to resolve 
mutually exclusive STA applications triggers return of the spectrum to the Commission’s 
inventory, the STA process would leave the spectrum in limbo indefinitely.25 
Second , the STA process that carriers propose would perpetuate the large-area, high-
power, licensed-exclusive paradi gm where that spectrum access approach already has been 
unsuccessful, either because a bidder failed to mate rialize or a licensee retu rned spectrum to the 
Commission.26  This would not advance national object ives to deliver more spectrum bandwidth 
to American consumers or make more efficient use of spectrum.27  One carrier even asserts that 
the Commission should grant inventory spectrum STAs only to wireless carriers with the ability 
to use the spectrum to supplement their existing ne tworks, and wireless carriers’ familiarity with 
the STA process makes them especia lly well qualified to hold STAs.28  In other words, the 
carrier asserts that the Commission should allo w only wireless carrier s to access inventory 
spectrum, and those carriers should do so only through the use of STAs, presumably so those 
embedded carriers can more easily acquire the spectrum on a licensed-exclusive basis once the

"9 Commission regains auction authority.  Such an  approach would benefit nationwide wireless 
carriers by creating another opportu nity to bolster their domina nt spectrum positions, and it 
would exacerbate the ways that  typical auction and operating rules for licensed-exclusive 
spectrum effectively fo reclose competition a nd innovation from new entr ants and alternative 
spectrum uses. 
B. Licensed-exclusive frameworks alone cannot sustain U.S. technological 
leadership and competitiveness. 
Arguments that prioritizi ng licensed-exclusive spectrum access frameworks would 
reinforce U.S. technological l eadership on the global stage mis apprehend the consequences of 
such a policy.29  Global spectrum harmonizat ion centered on the type  of licensed-exclusive 
frameworks that nationwide wire less carriers favor would bene fit Chinese state-sponsored 
companies like Huawei and ZTE, which already dominate the global mark etplace for equipment 
that supports licensed-ex clusive 5G networks.30  Rather than focusing on licensed-exclusive 
frameworks to further cement these companie s’ global dominance, NCTA encourages the 
Commission to employ “spectrum policy as a critical lever to retain global leadership in wireless 
technology . . . [through] a vi rtuous cycle of innovation.”31  The Commission can do this by

"10 innovations in Wi-Fi and CBRS-style sharing, to th e benefit of U.S. technological leadership and 
competitiveness. 
Nationwide wireless carriers argue that ther e is no need for additional unlicensed and 
licensed-shared spectrum, based in  part on their false narrative that those allocations outnumber 
licensed-exclusive allocations in the mid-band.32  To begin with, almost all spectrum allocated 
for commercial use in the U.S. is licensed on an exclusive basis.33  As a result, AT&T, Verizon, 
and T-Mobile together hold approximately 78 percent of all spectrum included in the 
Commission’s spectrum screen, measured on a MHz-POPs basis.34 
The carriers’ argument also is based on the incorrect assumption th at one megahertz of 
licensed-exclusive spectrum is eq uivalent to one megahertz of licensed-shared or unlicensed 
spectrum and ignores that license d-exclusive, unlicensed, and li censed-shared spectrum bands 
are subject to different rules and significant ope rational limitations that render a megahertz-to-
megahertz comparison inappropriate.35  Specifically, licensed-exclusive frameworks allow a 
single entity the right to use frequencies in a license area to th e exclusion of all other users, while 
unlicensed bands require sharing among many user s in the same geograp hic area, and licensed-
shared spectrum affords licensees rights subordinate to those of incumbent users.36  Prioritizing

"11 licensed-exclusive frame works based on this inapt compar ison would undermine the U.S.’s 
global technological leadership and competitivene ss.  Real investment in innovations that will 
secure U.S. leadership requires the Commission ’s commitment to the use of unlicensed and 
licensed-shared coexistence frameworks wherever feasible. 
C. The value of coexistence frameworks can exceed the value of a clear-and-
auction approach to licensed-exclusive spectrum use. 
Nationwide wireless carriers argue that coexistence-based frameworks would not 
generate auction revenue and related economic value,37 but they fail to acknowledge (1) the 
substantial economic benefits of licen sed-shared and unlicensed frameworks and (2) the 
prohibitive costs of clearing a nd relocating incumbent spectrum  users, a prerequisite to 
auctioning new licensed-exclusive spectrum.38  First , the value of licensed-shared and unlicensed 
frameworks like CBRS and 6 GHz Wi-Fi already is  manifest.  Sharing in the CBRS band adds 
“significant non-private value from increased participation of non-traditio nal users and 
innovative uses of spectrum.”39  CBRS-style sharing and the value it creates are replicable in 
other bands – most notably, the 3.1-3.45 GHz band.  By enabling a diverse set of operators to 
access the spectrum, “CBRS-style sharing fosters greater innovation and novel uses, [which] can 
lead to increases in economic  value and consumer welfare.”40  Licensed-shared frameworks can 
produce substantial auction revenues, especially where licenses cover sma ller geographic areas,

Likewise, the economic value of  Wi-Fi is immense and continues to grow.  Globally, Wi-
Fi helped generate 3.2 million jobs in 2021 a nd is expected to reach 4 million jobs by 2025.41  
Moreover, studies predict that the global economi c value of Wi-Fi will reach  nearly $5 trillion in 
2025,42 with a value of $1.58 trillion in the U.S. alone.43 
Second , licensed-exclusive proponents assume away or minimize the costs to other 
parties of facilitating a clear-and-auction approach.  The 2023 Brattle Study illustrates the extent 
to which prioritizing licensed- shared frameworks can enhance economic value and consumer 
welfare, and auctioning licensed-exclusive spectr um can have the opposite effect.  It concludes 
that CBRS-style sharing in the 3.1 -3.45 GHz band – with conservative  estimates of costs to clear 
incumbents – maximizes the social net value of the spectrum as compared to a licensed-exclusive 
regime.44  Notably, the Brattle Study finds that taki ng into account the estimated $120 billion to 
relocate federal operations, a clear-and-auction approach to licensed-exclusive use of the 3.1-
3.45 GHz band would yield lower auction revenues than would a licensed-shared approach.45  In

CONCLUSION 
 NCTA supports the Commission’s efforts to make inventory spectrum available for 
commercial use during the current lapse in auction authority.  Re storation of the Commission’s 
auction authority remains a priority but will no t address inefficient spectrum use and existing 
disparities in spectrum access.  The inventory spectrum that is the subject of this proceeding 
demonstrates that auctioning larg e-area, high-powered, licensed-exclusive spectrum can result in 
significant swaths of unused spect rum.  To foster a balanced sp ectrum policy that promotes U.S. 
economic growth and technologica l leadership, and maximizes be nefits for a diverse set of 
consumers and use cases, the Commission should prioritize coexistence-based spectrum access 
frameworks.  For these reasons, NCTA encourag es the Commission to consider coexistence-
based frameworks not only for i nventory spectrum, but also as pr omptly as possible in the Lower 
3 GHz, 7 GHz, Lower 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands, which are ripe for action and can deliver 
significant near-term benefits, as desc ribed in NCTA’s opening comments.

REPLY COMMENTS OF DIRECTV, LLC 
In this proceeding, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau sought comment on a 
simple question:  “how the Commission, if necessary, could use its current statutory authority to 
provide the public with access to its inventory of currently unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions (hereafter, Inventory Spectrum).”
1  In 
its comments, EchoStar Corporation (“EchoStar”) strayed well beyond that topic to urge the Commission to authorize two -way, high- power fixed terrestrial operations in the 12 GHz band.
2  
But the Commission has never auctioned licenses for such a service in that band, so there is no such Inventory Spectrum available .   
Indeed, this spectrum is intensively used by DIRECTV’s Direct Broadcast Satellite 
(“DBS”) service to deliver video programming to millions of subscribers across the country.  It is also used  by emerging non- geostationary orbit satellite systems providing broadband services in

 the band.  In other words, this spectrum is not simply lying around unused and awaiting 
Commission assignment.  
The Commission  rejected EchoStar’s call to authorized high- power mobile operations in 
the 12 GHz band because it would “ impose a significant risk of harmful interference to existing 
and emergent services in the band, including satellite services .”3  It is currently considering 
whether  the band can support  terrestrial  fixed  services in addition to the  Multichannel Video 
Delivery and Data Service (“MVDDS ”) without causing interference to the services of satellite 
incumbents.4  In that proceeding, DIRECTV and others have demonstrated that introducing a 
high- power, two- way fixed service to the band would cause massive interference to the satellite 
services enjoyed by millions of Americans.5  Moreover, even if a  high- power  service were 
allowed,  the record of that proceeding includes significant opposition to EchoStar’s proposal to 
simply hand any new or enhanced terrestrial rights in the band to the MVDDS operators that have to date allowed this spectrum to sit idle.
6 
The ongoing 12 GHz proceeding is the proper venue for considering such matters.  The 
Commission should ignore EchoStar’s attempt to use this proceeding to make a desperate end run around the significant opposition to its proposals that have been properly s ubmitted for 
Commission consideration  in the appropriate forum .

COMMENTS OF VERIZON 
I. INTRODUCTION.  
 Auctions are an essential tool in the FCC ’s pursuit of  sound spectrum policy.  As the 
Public Notice observes: “auctions have helped to fuel competition, to provide consumers with a 
vast array of wireless technologies and services, and to increase the likelihood that the Nation’s scarce spectrum resources are put to their highest and best use.”
1  Indeed, the Commission’s 
auction framework is the bedrock of exclusive -use licensed spectrum,  and the engine that drives 
today’s mobile connected society and the 5G fixed wireless access solutions that are delivering new competition into the home broadband marketplace.   
 We agree with Chairwoman Rosenworcel that  Congress must  renew the Commission’s 
spectrum license auction authority and that auctions are “an indispensable tool for harnessing the 
promise of new wireless technologies[.]”
2  Indeed, the Commission’s auction framework

Spectrum Auction Authority and Potential Creative Solutions to Maintain U.S. Leadership (Mar. 7, 2024)  (“Chairwoman Rosenworcel Statement”) .",0,Verizon Access to Inventory Spectrum PN Comments (4.8.24).pdf,VERIZON,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"2 promotes investment, deployment, and innovation in networks, leading to massive economic 
growth and consumer welfare enhancement.  
 The Public Notice seeks comment on whether there are options for making Inventory 
Spectrum3 available in light of the unprecedented lapse in the Commission’s auction authority.  
But the Commission should refrain from upending previously auctioned spectrum bands and 
turning to inferior spectrum access frameworks  that could undermine the efficient use of 
spectrum at  crucial time where policymakers must  focus on establishing a strong spectrum 
pipeline to promote advanced wireless networks .  Rather, the Commission should continue to 
urge Congress to restore its auction authority while  pursuing the special temporary authority 
(“STA”) option identified in the Public Notice to grant temporary access to Inventory Spectrum  
to ensure that those frequencies do not  continue to  lie fallow.  When auction authority is restored, 
the Commission should then auction such spectrum. 
II. EXCLUSIVE -USE SPECTRUM, ASSIGNED VIA AUCTION, CREATES 
ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND ENABLES THE NETWORKS THAT POWER 
OUR WORLD.   
 It is not an overstatement to say that the Commission’s successful auction assignment 
mechanisms, coupled with flexible -use policies, are in large part responsible for the connected 
world we live in today.  The Commission should continue to rely on market  forces and its 
extraordinarily successful auction framework to maintain its worldwide lead ership  in innovation 
and investment in mobile broadband services.  
 
3 Consistent with the Public Notice, “Inventory Spectrum” refers to exclusive -use, geographic 
area-based spectrum licenses across multiple wireless services that were previously made 
available via competitive bidding but were either not acquired at auction or returned to the Commission after issuance.  Public Notice ¶ 7.",1,Verizon Access to Inventory Spectrum PN Comments (4.8.24).pdf,VERIZON,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"3  Wireless—underpinned by auctioned, exclusive- use licensed spectrum and flexible- use 
policies —contributes significantly to our nation’s economy, supports consumer welfare, and 
promotes American technical superiority over global adversaries.  As Chairwoman 
Rosenworcel noted, auctions “spur[] economic growth, create[e] jobs, and strengthen[] our national security and international leadership.”
4  Indeed, relying on auctioned, exclusive- use 
licensed spectrum, the U.S. wireless industry has deployed wide-area networks with a stunning impact on the U.S. economy.   
● During the 4G decade, from 2010 to 2020, the wireless industry supported one out of 
every six American jobs,
5 and gross output from the U.S. wireless industry topped $9.5 
trillion.6  Because the U.S. led the world in 4G, the app economy was born and thrived in 
the United States.7 
● 5G is projected to create an additional 4.6 million jobs and contribute up to $1.7 trillion to U.S. GDP over the next decade, spurring activity across the consumer, industrial, and public sectors.
8   
With networks increasingly delivering high- capacity, low -latency capabilities, today with 5G and 
in the years to come with 6G, new applications and services will develop, contributing further to 
economic growth.

"4  Wide- area n etworks using licensed spectrum enhance consumer welfare as Americans 
rely more than ever on wireless to navigate their daily lives, be it working remotely or on- the-go, 
streaming videos or calls, attending telehealth appointments, accessing connected education in 
the classroom and at home, and much, much more.  And commercial, wide -area, full -power, 
reliable networks are critical to protect our national securit y interests.  The United States is 
competing with China and other rival nations for technological superiority, and China continues to advance traditional licensed models for spectrum that our international partners are embracing.  To maintain global leader ship and protect national security, exclusive -use access must be a 
continued domestic focus.  Exclusive- use, flexible -rights, and interference- protected spectrum, assigned via 
auction, generates massive investment in new wireless technologies and deployments, as Verizon’s history highlights.  Acquiring commercial wireless licenses at auction comes with a 
high- dollar price tag that creates incentives to make full use of  those frequencies and to invest 
heavily in highly efficient wireless network technologies that make the most of them.  Exclusive -
use, flexible -rights, and interference -protected licenses, made available via auction, provide the 
certainty needed to invest tens of billions of dollars each year to deploy wide -area wireless 
networks that expand connectivity, promote broadband competition, and advance U.S. economic interests.   Verizon has been at the heart of the wireless transformation for more than two decades —

"5 innovation.9  Below we highlight a few milestones that demonstrate how Verizon’s access to 
auctioned spectrum has helped to create the ultra -connected world we live in today:  
● Verizon completed its first live 3G wireless data call in July 2000, ushering in a new era 
in wireless technology.10  At that time, Verizon’s engineers downloaded a web page at 
153 Kbps, ten times faster than what was then available on legacy CDMA networks.  Today, Verizon’s 5G network provides speeds up to 200 Mbps. 
● Verizon launched the first 3G network in the United States in January 2002 using PCS and Cellular spectrum.
11  That network would grow to support the first picture 
messaging, or MMS.12  Of course today, we now have ubiquitous access to video calls. 
● Verizon won $9.4 billion worth of 700 MHz wireless spectrum licenses in 2008 that paved the way for the launch of the first nationwide 4G LTE network in the United States.
13  On that network, Verizon launched its first mobile tablet.14  Just 14 years later, 
mobile tablets are a staple of everyday life for many Americans, and many children use them in the classroom.  Since that time, Verizon has also bought and deployed AWS-1 and AWS -3 spectrum to augment its LTE capacity to meet custome rs’ demands. 
● In late 2018, Verizon launched 5G Home broadband internet service, built on the world’s first 5G Ultra Wideband Network  relying on 28 GHz spectrum acquired at auction .

when it won at auction an average of 161 MHz of C-Band nationwide.18  As soon as 
repurposing permitted, in July 2022 Verizon began deploying that spectrum, offering significantly higher speeds and greater capacity on its 5G network.  By March 2023, Verizon’s  5G Ultra Wideband network reached 200  million,  providing service to two out

Verizon’s network and the connected world we enjoy and depend on would not be possible 
without access to exclusive- use spectrum acquired at auction.  
 The Commission’s auctions program is globally recognized as an innovative, efficient force in spectrum policy.  The Commission’s spectrum auction framework has been replicated worldwide and is the epitome of U.S.  global leadership in spectrum policy.  As one auction 
economist has noted, “many countries wisely have imitated the FCC auctions; those that have 
not have suffered from inefficient license assignments and other flaws.”

"7 auction framework is globally acclaimed.  In 2020, two of the economists that helped design the 
Commission’s first spectrum auction were awarded a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences,22 and, 
more recently, the Commission received a Technology & Engineering Emmy® Award by the 
National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for the creativity and engineering design of the FCC’s Broadcast Incentive Auction.
23 
 Spectrum auctions support efficient license assignments and can support other 
important policy goals.  In addition to ensuring that spectrum is put to its highest and best use, auctions can create a funding mechanism to help pay to repurpose spectrum—ultimately making spectrum use more efficient and sometimes allowing incumbents to pay for newer and better technologies.  Auctions can also support other public policy objectives.  For example, the AWS-3 auction introduced 65 megahertz of spectrum into the marketplace to support wireless broadband, while also generating $7 billion to fund the Public Safety Trust Fund, $300 million for public safety communications research, $115 million in grants for 911 implementation, over $20 billion for deficit reduction, and funding to relocate federal systems out of the band.

novel Broadcast Incentive Auction resulted in more efficient spectrum use by paying broadcasters to relocate, freeing up the largest amount of licensed low- band spectrum ever made

III. THE FCC SHOULD CONTINUE TO RELY ON AUCTIONS, ONCE 
AUTHORITY IS RESTORED, TO MAKE ITS INVENTORY SPECTRUM  
AVAILABLE . 
 Exclusive -use, flexible -rights licensed access to the Inventory Spectrum has already 
proven to be the most effective means to put these spectrum bands to their highest and best use.  
The bands have successful licensing frameworks and technical rules assoc iated with them, as 
well as developed equipment ecosystems.  The Inventory Spectrum, moreover, includes highly valuable spectrum that is critical to the deployment of nationwide wireless networks.  These bands should continue to be available for exclusive -use, licensed operations assigned by auction.  
 The lack of auction authority is temporary, and there is no reason to stray from the 
enormously successful license -by-auction approach to the Inventory Spectrum bands.  Indeed, 
standing up sharing frameworks or dynamic systems, or restricting eligible use  to non- exclusive, 
site-based licensing in Inventory Spectrum would be time consuming, complicated, inefficient, 
and result in pockets of spectrum subject to different rules that would lower investment in these important bands and decrease their value.  These options are inferior to assigning Inventory Spectrum by auction.        
First, as a practical matter, introducing any dynamic sharing or non- exclusive site -based 
licensing in these bands would not make sense.
26  The  spectrum sharing frameworks used in 
Citizens Broadband Radio Spectrum (“CBRS”) and in the 6 GHz band took years to develop and implement, and neither could easily be transferred to the Inventory Spectrum.  The Commission

"9 will regain its auction authority, and could auction the Inventory Spectrum, long before any new 
spectrum access framework can be adopted  here and before compatible equipment could be 
developed.   
 Second, standing up sharing frameworks in these bands would not be in the public 
interest.  Verizon is both an auction winner of licensed spectrum in the Inventory Spectrum bands and the largest holder of Priority Access Licenses in CBRS.  The sharing model and the customized tools that CBRS requires have proven challenging to manage, particularly given the regular operational updates that are needed for base station products and the myriad ad hoc workarounds that are being used to accommodate General Authorized Access grants.  Spectrum sharing frameworks, like CBRS, do not enable the assured access and wide -area capability that is 
fundamental to full -fledged wireless service.  Thus, introducing sharing into the bands that are 
already designed to support robust wireless service would be contrary to the public interest.   
 Rather than introducing sub- optimal access regimes in bands that already have settled 
licensing and technical rules, the Commission could rely on its special temporary authority to grant access to Inventory Spectrum licenses on a temporary basis.  As the Public Notice observes, STAs are a “well -established access mechanism [to] provide[] for non- interfering use 
of the spectrum.”

spectrum during the coronavirus pandemic.28  The Public Notice also asks about leasing 
Spectrum Inventory licenses.29  Such a framework would pose complicated legal questions as no

"10 licensees hold the Inventory Spectrum to lease it under Commission rules, and there may be legal 
hurdles to the FCC leasing spectrum to users without statutory authority.  In any event this framework is unnecessary since existing STA authority would appear to enable access to Inventory Spectrum on a temporary basis.  Here, the Commission can use STAs to enable access to Inventory Spectrum on a temporary basis so spectrum does not lie fallow, and once Congress reauthorizes the auction authority, the Commission can terminate the STAs and launch an auction for the Inventory Spectrum.    IV. CONCLUSION. 
 The Commission is right to focus on ensuring that useful spectrum does not lie fallow.  But rather than injecting inefficient methods of allocation into the spectrum policy bloodstream, the Commission should continue to encourage Congress to restore its auction authority.  T he 
public interest would not be served by spending the time and resources to introduce inferior spectrum access mechanisms into existing licensed bands.  In the meantime, the public can access Inventory Spectrum through the Commission’s existing STA authority.

COMMENTS OF FEDERATED WIRELESS, INC.  
 
Federated Wireless, Inc.  (“Federated Wireless ”) hereby submits these comments in response to the 
Public Notice  (“PN”) issued by the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”)  in the above -
captioned proceeding,  in which the Commission  seeks comments on how, in light of the ongoing lapse of 
the Commission’s auction authority, it can make unassigned spectrum (“Inventory Spectrum”) available to 
support the deployment of advanced wireless services across the country .
1   
Federated Wireless commends the Commission for its ongoing efforts to ensure that valuable 
spectrum resources are not sitting fallow and are instead  made available to the public  expeditiously and 
efficiently .  Federated Wireless further commends the  Commission  for recognizing that it has technology 
and tools available that can facilitate spectrum access for a wide variety of users.   Indeed, t he Commission’s 
experience with multiple different  automated dynamic  spectrum management solutions has shown how 
these tools  can be used to streamline spectrum access and increase efficient use in furtherance of the 
Commission’s goals .2  Moreover, such tools have proven to be  far more reliable and cost -effective than 
other manual coordination approaches that have historically been used for nonexclusive site -based 
licensees.

Notice, FCC 24-215 (2024) (“PN”). 
2 The success of the CBRS band is  a case in point .  With over 370,000 CBRS devices deployed by more than 1,200 
different operators, the CBRS licensing and DSMS- based management framework is a shining example of how 
spectrum resources can be made available in a cost -effective and efficient manner while promot ing both commercial 
consumer -oriented services and a proliferation of private wireless networks for a wide variety of industrial and 
social use cases .",0,FederatedWireless.UnassignedSpectrum.PN.Comments.04-08-24.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"2 Federated Wireless has a wealth of experience with dynamic spectrum management, having served 
both as a Spectrum Access System (“SAS”) administrator in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service 
(“CBRS”) band and as an Automated Frequency Coordination (“AFC”) system operator in the 6 GHz band .  
Based on this experience, Federated Wireless supports the adoption of a nonexclusive, shared access 
licensing framework  – such as the licensed -by-rule framework adopted for CBRS  – that is enabled by a n 
automated  Dynamic Sp ectrum Management System (“DSMS”)  to accommodate a variety of prospective 
users of Inventory Spectrum.   A light-touch DSMS tool can be readily adapted from existing, proven 
solutions to address challenges such as the protection of other co - and adjacent channel licensed users in a 
variety of frequency bands , and to facilitate co -existence amongst new users.  As is the case with sharing 
frameworks that have successfully  been implemented in other bands, using DSMS technology for Inventory 
Spectrum would provi de for modernized frequency coordination and band access managemen t while 
leveraging a high degree  of automation to enable efficient and intensive sharing among users , minimi ze 
barriers to  entry , and accelerat e deployments.  
There are clear benefits to the DSMS -managed, license-by-rule model that should be considered 
for Inventory Spectrum .  For example, in the CBRS G eneral Authorized Access (“GAA”)  tier, users do not 
need to acquire or pay for a license in advance of their planned operations.  Instead, spectrum access is 
authorized in near real -time and without human intervention.  This automated access model is cultivating a 
vibrant ecosystem of eq uipment and device suppliers, including those offering “5G in a box” solutions.  
Moreover, this approach  lowers economic barriers to entry for smaller deployments, such as private 
wireless networks.   
The GAA automated access model also minimizes administrative burdens and prevents spectrum 
warehousing.  By requiring transmitters to maintain a heartbeat with the DSMS in order to  retain their  
spectrum authorization, there is no need for build- out requirements or reservation periods to ensure 
spectrum is not lying fallow.  The CBRS SAS enables devices to request a spectrum assignment that remains 
valid for at least seven days,  so long as the heartbeat between the device and the SAS is maintained.  This 
same model, with less stringent requirements than those adopted to ensure protection of incumbents in the 
CBRS band, could be easily adapted to Inventory Spectrum (as well as to the 42 GHz and lower 37 GHz",1,FederatedWireless.UnassignedSpectrum.PN.Comments.04-08-24.pdf,FEDERATED WIRELESS,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"3 bands ) to ensure spectrum usage is efficient, intensive, and continuous. 
Federated Wireless does not oppose a non -exclusive site-based licensing approach that is managed 
by a third-party coordinator, which would avoid the burdens associated with manual coordination.  If the 
Commission were to adopt  such an approach, we would recommend that the third-party coordinator rely 
on automated  spectrum tools to facilitate registration and de-confliction, which would speed time -to-
market, provide greater certainty, and maximize efficient spectrum usage.   
Similarly, Federated Wireless  also does not oppose the Commission’s proposals to allow access 
to Inventory Spectrum through l easing or grants of Special Temporary Authority (“STA”) .  Both  
approaches, however, would greatly benefit from the use of  automated  DSMS tools to streamline the 
application process, speed time-to -market, provide greater certainty, and maximize efficient spectrum 
usage.   As we have seen in the CBRS band, automation of spectrum access spurs growth and ongoing 
demand from a wide variety of consumer -oriented broadband services as well as private wireless network 
use cases.3  The burdens associated with manual application processes for leases and STAs, on the other 
hand, risk dampening interest in and the use of Inventory Spectrum.  Moreover, such approaches would make Inventory Spectrum less suitable for events requiring spectrum access for short periods of time 
and/or for near -term events.    
In recognition of the shortcomings of manual application processes, the Commission permitted  
SAS administrators to offer streamlined leasing services to facilitate secondary market transactions for CBRS Priority Access Licenses (“PALs”).  Federated Wireless was approved to offer light-touch leasing 
after demonstrating that our SAS successfully communicates with the Commission’s licensing databases 
via an Application Programming Interface (“API”)  to facilitate PAL lease transactions.  We developed a 
similar tool to streamline applications for local, Shared Access Licenses (“SAL”)  in the United Kingdom.   
This automated software-based tool enables SAL applicants to:  a)  identify in advance of filing an 
application what spectrum is available to support their use case in a particular geographic area; b)

"4 leverage third -party , automated cloud-based services that rely solely on machine-to -machine interfaces to 
file SAL applications ; and c) interface directly with the U.K. regulator’s  licensing databases and other 
services to ease access, management, and support of offline analysis.  Federated Wireless urges the 
Commission to leverage such commercially -available and proven spectrum sharing solutions  to make 
Inventory Spectrum available – whether through a license -by-rule, non-exclusive site-based licensing 
approach managed by a third-party coordinator , leasing, or STA framework.  
In conclusion, Federated Wireless applauds the Commission for its continued efforts to put 
Inventory Spectrum to use to support the deployment of advanced wireless services.  To meet this goal, 
Federated Wireless urges the Commission to adopt a licensed -by-rule approach and leverage existing and 
proven DSMS tools to enable the most efficient use of Inventory Spectrum  through automated coordination.  
Federated Wireless stands ready to work with the Commission and all stakeholders to implement a DSMS 
solution  that enables the most efficient and intensive use of Inventory Spectrum , which would  ultimately 
bring the greatest utility to the  American people in the form of expanded fixed and mobile broadband 
services.

"2 I. INTRODUCTION  AND SUMMARY  
The Commission’s authority to conduct spectrum auctions has been an unambiguous  
success, allowing spectrum to be acquired by entities that value it the most to provide cutting -
edge wireless service s to the public.   The lapse of the Commission’s spectrum auction authority  
for the first time in three decades  has prevented the Commissio n from making additional 
spectrum available to meet the Nation’s ever -expanding connectivity requirements.  T -Mobile 
therefore applauds the Bureau for exploring how its existing regulatory tools can be used to 
provide the public with access to Inventory Sp ectrum  during this unprecedented time . 
While reinstatement of the Commission’s spectrum auction authority must be a 
Congressional priority, in the interim, the Bureau should focus on how the public can most 
effectively use Inventory Spectrum on an interim basis.  Relying on STA s that mirror, to the 
extent feasible, regular authorizations will best achieve that outcome by (i) align ing the 
temporary authorizations with those for existing licensees  and therefore allow ing providers to 
seamlessly add the spectru m to their networks  to provide enhanced service to customers ; 
(ii) provid ing appropriate  temporary  access to Inventory Spectrum; and (iii)  ensur ing prompt  
access to the spectrum .  To maximize the benefit to the public of the temporary use of Inventory 
Spectrum t he Bureau  should accept STA requests from providers that would use  Inventory 
Spectrum  to supplement  their spectrum holdings in their existing networks .   
The Bureau should avoid implementing complex spectrum access regimes such as 
dynam ic spectrum sharing, non -exclusive site -based licensing, and spectrum leasing  for the 
temporary use of Inventory Spectrum .  Adopting those mechanisms would not conform with the 
way that Inventory Spectrum is otherwise licensed and would require a lengthy p eriod to 
implement , if it could be done at all .  Those outcomes would defeat the purpose of the Bureau’s",3,T-Mobile -- Comments on Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum.pdf,T -MOBILE USA,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

Spectrum and the time when auction authority is restored.  
II. FCC SPECTRUM AUCTIONS HAVE BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS  
Since the Commission was first granted spectrum auction authority more than 30 years 
ago, spectrum auctions have brought countless benefits to the wireless industry and the American 
public.3/  Indeed, t he Commission  has conducted more than 100 spectrum auctions and raised 
more than $233 billion in spectrum auction revenues for deficit reduction and broader 
government use.4/  Spectrum auctions also drive investment  and support economic growth .  As 
CTIA recently reported, the wireless industry has invested more than $309 billion into wireless 
networks, which rely primarily on auctioned  spectrum , since 2012 .5/  And today, the wireless 
industry supports  4.5 million jobs and contributes $825 billion  to our economy each year – 
equivalent to the 19th  largest economy in the world – thanks in large part  to auctioned spectrum .6/ 
As Chairwoman Rosenworcel has observed, the Commission’s authority to conduct 
spectrum auctions has “proved to be an ind ispensable tool for harnessing the promise of new 
wireless technologies while also spurring economic growth, creating jobs, and strengthening our

"5 III. THE BUREAU SHOULD RELY ON ITS EXISTING STA FRAMEWORK TO 
TEMPORARILY AUTHORIZE INVENTORY SPECTRU M 
While prompt Congressional action to restore spectrum auction authority is the best way 
to ensure that spectrum is authorized to those who value it the most and will put it to use, until 
that occurs, the Bureau should use its authority to ensure that con sumers benefit from the 
spectrum  on a temporary basis using the Commission’s existing ability to issue STA.11/  First , 
STAs will most closely align with the existing licensing scheme  for traditionally auctioned 
spectrum.  That will  allow providers to seamlessly supplement their networks to provide service 
to customers.  For instance , where customers are already being provided with service  through 
auctioned spectrum , STAs covering the same or a similar geographic area can be used to help 
increase a provider ’s capacity in th at area.   In fact , providers can readily  supplement their 
networks and provide better services to their customers if they have access to spectrum  in bands 
in which they are already authorized and /or in areas that cl osely map to their existing service 
footprint.  
Second , use of STAs is appropriate because they are intended to provide temporary 
access to spectrum under extraordinary circumstances.12/  The lapse – for the first time ever  – of 
spectrum auction authority qualifies as the type of extraordinary circumstance envisioned by the 
Communications Act.  Moreover, the FCC’s spectrum auction authority will likely be restored 
soon .  Therefore, only temporary access to Inventory Spectrum is required  – the precise type of 
access the STA framework envisions .  Providing temporary access to  Inventory Spectrum 
through STA will also ensure that the Bureau can support provide rs and their subscribers  without  
 
11/ See 47 U.S.C. § 309(f)  (stating that the Commission may grant STA under Section 309(f) of the 
Communications Act “if it finds that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring temporary  
operations in the public interest  . . .”) (emphasis added ); see also Public Notice ¶ 11.

"6 creating any expectation of permanent r ights to Inventory Spectrum or interfering with the 
Commission’s ability to later issue regular licenses  via auction . 
Third , granting STAs can occur  promptly .  The Commission already has well -established 
rules and processes to issue STAs.13/  Wireless  carriers are also familiar with those processes .  
That means Inventory Spectrum can be made available quickly , and consumers can obtain the 
benefits of the addition al capacity as soon as possible.   
Although the Bureau should move swiftly to grant access to Inventory Spectrum through 
STA s, it should  establish procedures for Inventory Spectrum that will help ensure consumers get 
access to the spectrum with minimal del ay.  In particular, it should  accept STA requests only 
from licensees that are capable of integrating the spectrum into their existing  networks in the 
same geographic area covered by the STA request.  Under usual circumstances , the Commission 
should encour age all interested parties to apply for spectrum that they can put to use .  But  
Inventory Spectrum will only be available temporarily and briefly, until auction authority is 
restored.  It is unrealistic to expect that the public can be served using Inventory Spectrum by an 
entity not already providing service in an area.  Indeed, the Commission’s performance 
requirements allow licensees years to put spectr um to use.14/  Inventory Spectrum  will therefore 
most effectively be  used to supplement  existing networks to expand capacity for customers 
already being served.   
Moreover, g ranting STAs to only those  parties  already providing service in an area to 
supplem ent their existing networks would reduce the risk that customers would experience a

licensee’s renewal application); 24.103 (a) (establishing interim and final const ruction requirements at five

STA after the spectrum is ultimately auctioned .  Conversely, a llowing a ny entity to seek STA to 
use spectrum to initiate service in a n area could mean that  customers of the provider may have 
their service interrupted or even discontinued if the STA holder is not the ultimate licensee after 
the spectrum is eventually auctioned . 
T-Mobile recognizes that even with the limitations it suggests, multiple entities may be 
eligible to use Inventory Spectrum in an area.  To address that possibility, the Bureau should list 
STA requests for spectrum not already licensed or being used under an existing STA in a weekly 
Public Notice with a brief period during which parties may submit competing requests (provided 
they also satisfy the criterion described above) .  If there are no competing re quests to use 
Inventory Spectrum  or objections raised  within the Public Notice period, the STA request should 
be deemed granted.  If there are competing STA requests submitted that meet the criterion  above  
the parties should be permitted to negotiate to re solve mutual exclusivity  or address the 
objections .  Allowing parties to resolve disputes and resolve mutual exclusivity through 
negotiation is consistent with the Communications Act , which  expressly contemplates the use of 
negotiations  to resolve mutual e xclusivity .15/ 
Once authorized, carriers should be subject to the same service rules that are applicable to 
the spectrum band for which they seek access.  That will ensure consistency in operations among 
STA holders and permanent licensees across the bands .  It will also eliminate concerns about  
harmful interference  because operations pursuant to STA would be subject to the same technical 
rules  as existing operations .  Because STAs are temporary, utilizing an STA should have no

Commission has been clear that the mobile spectrum holdings analysis it conducts for licensees 
is reserved for permanent  authorizations .16/   
IV. THE USE OF OTHER SPECTRUM  ACCESS MECHANISMS WOULD BE 
INEFFICIENT  
The Bureau should refrain from adopting other spectrum access proposals, such as 
dynamic spectrum sharing, non -exclusive site -based licensing, or spectrum leasing  while it waits 
for spectrum auction authority to be restored .  While those mechanisms may be appropriate in 
some circumstances and for some spectrum bands, they are not appropriate for temporary use of 
Inventory Spectrum.   Permitting spectrum access throu gh these processes  will take extensive 
time to implement , further delay ing the use of Inventory Spectrum .  Those  alternative 
mechanisms  are also not tailored to make spectrum available in a way that would be useful to 
integrate into existing commercial net works and , therefore,  benefit consumers.    
A. Dynamic Spectrum Sharing  
Wireless customers expect and require network capacity that is always available .  But 
dynamic spectrum sharing only makes spectrum available at limited times , which restricts its 
usefulnes s for customers , especially in times of emergency .17/  Indeed, the marketplace has 
demonstrated that most commercial network  operator s are unwilling to rely on spectrum made 
available through dynamic spectrum sharing, as evidenced by the limited investment in and use 
 
16/ For example, the Commission does not count short -term leased spectrum as part of the spectrum 
holdings of the lessee because those leases are temporary in nature.  See Policies Regarding Mobile 
Spectrum Holdings , Report and Order, 29 FC C Rcd 6133, ¶ 301 (2014).

"9 of the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) band.18/  Sharing mechanisms that, 
in practice, mean that spectrum cannot be used to support 5G and 6G wi reless networks would 
simply make ineffective, or at least inefficient , use of Inventory Spectrum  even on a temporary 
basis . 
Dynamic spectrum sharing is also inconsistent with how most commercial networks 
operate.   Spectrum sharing regimes are generally premised upon relatively low -power 
operations, which may be  necessary to protect incumbents in repurposed spectrum bands.  For 
example, in the 6 GHz band, the Commission adopted rules permitting shared access to the band 
by low -power devices to protect incum bent services.19/  But, as noted above, the most effective 
temporary use of Inventory Spectrum will be by providers with existing networks.   And because 
those existing networks are already operating with higher power the Bureau should likewise 
permit Inven tory Spectrum to be used for higher -power operations , an outcome generally 
inconsistent with dynamic spectrum sharing .   
In addition, developing  a dynamic spectrum sharing regime would be too time consuming 
to be beneficial.   The purpose of this proceeding  is to explore how to make Inventory Spectrum 
temporarily available quickly  in the absence of spectrum auction authority.  Developing and 
implementing a dynamic spectrum sharing regime would fail to achieve that goal.  Indeed, it

sharing in the 6 GHz band, wh ich the Commission permitted for unlicensed use approximately 
four years ago, was only recently authorized  and is not yet widely deployed .21/  Solutions that 
will take years to develop are no solutions at all because the FCC’s spectrum auction authority 
will likely be restored before they can be implemented.   
B. Site-Based Licensing  
The Bureau should also reject the use of a non-exclusive , site-based licensing approach 
for Inventory Spectrum.   Similar to a dynamic spectrum sharing regime, making Inventory 
Spectrum available under a site -based licensing regime would create disparate technical 
obligations that could create confu sion, limiting the overall benefits of the spectrum to the 
public .  Much of the spectrum at issue is in spectrum bands that have otherwise been licensed on 
an exclusive geographic -area basis .  Subjecting some portions of those  spectrum band s to site-
based licensing would result in different operating parameters  for that spectrum , creating a 
patchwork of the same spectrum with different technical rules .  Moreover,  it would be necessary 
to develop engineering criteria  to resolve conflicts among potential appl icants for site -based

"11 licenses, which would require time that would likely extend beyond the period when spectrum 
auction authority  is restored.  
C. Spectrum Leasing  
Finally , the Bureau should not utilize a spectrum leasing regime to make Inventory 
Spectrum av ailable during the Commission’s lapse in spectrum auction authority.   T-Mobile 
agrees that spectrum leases are useful to facilitate more flexible and efficient access to 
spectrum.22/  But unlike traditional leasing arrangements, wireless carriers would be required to 
enter into leasing agreements  for Inventory Spectrum  directly with the Commission instead of 
with third  parties .  That approach would be problematic for several reasons.   
First , while t he Commission has clear statutory authority under the Communications Act 
to issue licenses23/ the Communications Act does not convey clear authority for the Commission 
to enter into leasing agreements with commercial entities .24/  In any case, l easing spectrum 
directly  to providers  on a short -term basis  would  be functionally equivalent to granting  an STA  – 
both would  confer temporary, short -term authority to use the spectrum .  Because  granting STA s

"12 is plainly within the Commission’s authority  under Section 309(f) of the Communications Act ,25/ 
the Bureau should take that well-established and legally sound approach instead.  
Second , the Commission would either (i) be required to adopt uniform rules and 
conditions that would be applicable to Commission -leased spectrum , or (ii) allow carriers to 
negotiate the individual terms of each spectrum lease agreement with the Bureau.  In either case, 
it would likely take months or longer for any spectrum leasing agreement to be formalized and, 
therefore, for any access to Inventory Spectrum to occur.  By the n, the Commission will likely 
have its spectrum auction authority restored.  
Last, traditional leasing arrangements generally envision payment for use of the spectrum 
by the lessee .  Indeed, payment for spectrum access would be one of the factors that would  make 
a lease from the FCC different from an STA .  But the Commission ’s authority to collect fees is 
prescribed by statute; it  has no authority to collect fees for entering into lease agreements (in 
addition to the authority to enter into the lease agreeme nt itself) .26/  Even if the Commission ha d 
authority to collect lease fees, to do so the Bureau would be required to value the spectrum that it 
is leasing.  Doing that would be a time -consuming and complex process and would likely result 
in challenges and disputes.  
V. CONCLUSION  
The Commission’s auction authority will be restored soon.  To allow Inventory Spectrum 
to be used most effectively until it is, the Commission should authorize Inventory Spectrum to 
provide consumers with greater capacity on the networks they already use.  The most effective 
way to do that is for the Bureau to  leverage its existing authority to grant STAs  using current

hereby submit these comments in response to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau’s 
(“Bureau”) Public Notice requesting comment on “how the Commission should fulfill its 
responsibility to make spectrum resources available for use in the public interest, in light of the 
ongoing lapse of the Commission’s auction authority.”
1   
I. INTRODUCTION  
For almost thirty years, the Commission  relied on the auction process as its primary means 
for providing access to spectrum on a licensed, exclusive -use basis.  Given the ongoing lapse of 
the Commission’s auction authority, the Bureau is exploring how the Commission could use its

 current statutory authority to provide the public with access to its inventory of unassigned spectrum 
in bands previously licensed through auctions (“Inventory Spectrum”) .2  In the Public Notice, the 
Bureau requests comment on various alternative  methods through which the Commission could 
provide  access to “Inventory Spectrum” in the absence of auction authority.3  However, the  
possible approaches identified in the Public Notice  do not provide potential users of this spectrum 
with the level of certainty necessary to incentivize the investment needed to put this spectrum to 
use in the public interest .  In particular, these approaches  largely rely on making spectrum available 
on an interim basis under shared use and/or secondary use models that do not provide the exclusivity and protection from interference that is required for many essential wireless networks  
and applications , including those that support the operation, safety, and security of the Nation’s 
critical infrastructure.  
Furthermore, while the Public Notice focuses on how to make Inventory Spectrum 
available in the absence of auction authority, this Inventory Spectrum exists – and remains fallow 
– as a result of the auction process itself .  With no way for the public to access this spectrum 
outside of the auction process , it has continued to lay fallow through all the years of the 
Commission’s auction authority.  The restoration of auction authority will not be enough by itself 
to make the Commission’s Inventory Spectrum available for use in the public interest, and the fact 
that this spectrum remains unassigned and unused demonstrates that alternatives to auctions are 
needed .  The Bureau – and the Commission – must therefore look beyond the interim approaches 
identified in the Public Notice and consider long- term alternatives that can be used instead of or

 in addition to the auction process to enable access to spectrum and ensure that all  of “the Nation’s 
scarce spectrum resources are put to their best and highest use.”4   
II. UTILITIES AND OTHER OPERATORS OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 
REQUIRE ACCESS TO SPECTRUM ON A LICENSED, EXCLUSIVE -USE BASIS  
The Nation’s critical electric, gas, and water utility infrastructure, which delivers essential 
services to the public, is increasingly reliant on advanced communications systems and 
technologies that allow for enhanced monitoring and control.  The electric grid in fact requires the 
development and deployment of advanced utility communications systems and technologies to 
support vital National interests: improving the resiliency, reliability, and security of the Nation’s electric grid is essential to our co untry’s economic, industrial, and technological development, 
essential to society, and essential to national security.  These communications also are crucial to greater energy efficiency and energy independence by enabling the emergence of distributed 
gene ration, greater penetration of renewable resources, and other efficiency efforts.  
Electric utilities , like other operators of critical infrastructure, use a variety of 
communications technologies and services to support the safe and efficient generation, 
transmission, and distribution of energy services to the public.  To fulfill these critical 
communica tions needs, utilities require access to spectrum on a licensed, exclusive -use basis that 
will allow them to directly operate communications networks in a way that meets the levels of 
reliability and resiliency necessary to support the cl ean, safe, efficient, and reliable delivery of 
essential electric services to the public.  Commercial service providers generally cannot meet the levels of coverage, reliability, and security required by utilities, and the growing prevalence of 
“smart grid ” and other advanced devices and technologies across the grid, combined with the

"4 
 constant risk of cyberattacks, has further heightened the imperative for electric utilities to directly 
control and operate the communications networks that underpin these vital grid support operations, rather than outsourcing this increasingly sensitive a nd vital function to third parties.   
For these reasons, utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure require certainty 
regarding the reliability , performance, and security of the spectrum available to them to justify 
long- term investment in the deployment of advanced communications systems and technologies 
to support their provision of essential services to the public.  Moreover, f or regulated utilities, any 
capital investment is borne by their customers and subject to scrutiny and approval by state regulatory bodies, thus further emphasizing the need for utilities to have certainty when investing in spectrum and building out systems to support their operations.   
III. THE APPROACHE S PROPOSED IN THE PUBLIC NOTICE DO NOT PROVIDE 
THE CERTAINTY NEEDED TO INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT AND ROBUST 
USE OF INVENTORY SPECTRUM  
Currently, utilities have very few options for accessing spectrum  – particularly spectrum 
with the certainty provided by licensed exclusive -use – and those limited options are increasingly 
insufficient in bandwidth.  T he ability to access Inventory Spectrum presents one potential solution 
to the problem of spectrum availability.  However , the approaches identified in the Public Notice 
do not provide utilities with the certainty needed to incentivize investment and robust use of 
Inventory Spectrum .
5     
Significantly, the Public Notice presents each of the identified approaches as an interim 
measure for providing  access to Inventory Spectrum until Congress restores the Commission’s 
auction authority and use of the spectrum is transitioned to entities who are assigned licenses through auction.   Because it cannot be known when Congress will restore the Commission’s 
 
5 / See id. at ¶ 13.",3,Utility Comments on Inventory Spectrum Public Notice (WT 24-72).pdf,EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"5 
 auction authority or when an auction may be held for any of the Inventory Spectrum bands, 
potential applicants will not have the certainty that is necessary to justify the long -term investment 
needed to put this spectrum to productive use in the public int erest.  
Moreover, the approaches identified in the Public Notice largely rely on making spectrum 
available through shared use and/or secondary use models that do not provide the exclusivity and protection from interference that is required for many essential wirel ess networks and applications, 
nor do they provide the certai nty needed to justify long- term investment by utilities .
6  To the extent 
that the proposed approach of leasing Inventory Spectrum would not necessarily require sharing 
or secondary use, a leasing framework would require significant time and resources to develop and implement, and the Commission’s authority to adopt a leasing approach is at best unclear, 
especially with respect to issues of mutual exclusivity.
7   
 Finally, the Commission does have clear authority and an established process for 
providing access to Inventory Spectrum through the grant of Special Temporary Authority 
(“STA”) and should continue to do so.  However, grants of STA are limited to 180 days ( which 
can be renewed), allow the spectrum to be used only on a secondary, non- interfering basis, and 
can only be granted under certain specified circumstances.8  Accordingly, while the use of STA 
may be appropriate in some cases, it is not sufficient to make Inventory Spectrum available for long- term use by utilities .

"6 
 IV. THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO LOOK BEYOND THE RESTORATION OF 
AUCTION AUTHORITY  
As discussed above, the Public Notice focuses  on alternative measures that could be 
employed to provide the public with access to fallow Inventory Spectrum “ unless and until  
Congress decides to restore the Commission’s auction authority.”9  In order to meet the Nation’s 
spectrum needs and ensure that this scarce resource is put to use in the public interest, however, 
the Commission needs to look beyond the restoration of its auction authority.  
The auction process is not , and should not be , the only way to make spectrum available on 
an exclusive -use basis , and the Commission must consider and be open to alternative approaches 
which may vary from case to case.  One example of such an alternative approach is the 
Commission’s recent realign ment of  the 5/5 megahertz block of spectrum  at 896- 901/935- 940 
MHz  (“900 MHz band”), which is successfully enabling access to licensed, exclusive -use 
broadband spectrum without the need for an auction.10     
The auction process also is not necessarily the most effective method for determining the 
best use of the Nation’s spectrum resources.  Often, t he success of the auction process is defined 
in terms of the amount of revenue raised for the U.S. Treasury.  However, auctions do not account for societal  value in considering whether spectrum is being put to its best and highest use in the 
public interest.   In a report prepared for Congress, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
described the importance of non- commercial use of spectrum in serving society :   
Wireless networks are an important component of smart grid 
communications, for example. Spectrum resources are also needed for 
railroad safety, for water conservation, for the safe maintenance of 
critical infrastructure industries, and for many other appli cations that

5183 (2020).",5,Utility Comments on Inventory Spectrum Public Notice (WT 24-72).pdf,EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"7 
 may not have an immediate commercial value but can provide long-
lasting value to society as a whole.11 
The CRS report further describes how auction- centric spectrum policies have hindered 
access to spectrum to serve important public and societal needs.  According to CRS:  
Some companies that might be well suited to meet social goals, such as 
access in rural areas, might have been precluded from bidding [at 
spectrum auctions] at all because of constraints not considered relevant 
to market -driven allocations. For example, public utilities, municipal 
co-operatives, commuter railroads, and other public or quasi -public 
entities face a variety of legal, regulatory, and structural constraints that 
limit or prohibit their ability to participate in an auction or buy spectrum 
licenses . Many of these constraints exist at the state level but federal 
spectrum policy plays a role in perpetuating the status quo.12  
The Public Notice defines Inventory Spectrum as “currently unassigned spectrum in bands 
previously licensed for wireless services through auctions.”13  In other words, this is spectrum that 
could not be successfully assigned or used even while the Commission had full auction authority.  
The amount of unassigned spectrum in the Commission’s inventory – together with the fact that 
this spectrum has continued to lay fallow for years , even decades , because there generally has been 
no way for the public to access this spectrum outside the auction process  – demonstrates that 
auctions are not necessarily the most effective way to make s pectrum  resources available for use 
in the public interest.    
The Commission must therefore look beyond the interim approaches identified in the 
Public Notice and consider long- term alternatives instead of or in addition to the auction process

Notice  seeking comment on options for facilitating  access to its inventory of currently  
unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions 
(“Inventory Spectrum ”).1  Given the uncertainty around  the restoration of auction authority, 
EchoStar agrees that the Commission  should consider alternative approaches  to promote 
competition in the wireless industry and benefit consumers.    
EchoStar supports the Commission’s efforts to put its idle Inventory Spectrum to work in 
ways that would benefit the public and improve competition.  With  those goals in mind, 
EchoStar  proposes that  (1) the  Inventory Spectrum be made available to non -dominant carriers , 
for free , as a first priority ; and that (2) the Commission seize the opportunity to unleash the 12.2 -
12.7 GHz spectrum for two -way fixed 5G broadband, a spectrum solution that does not, and has 
never, needed auction authority from Congress .

 II. Inventory Spectrum Should Be Deployed In Service Of Competition  
Inventory Spectrum, especially low and mid band spectrum,  should be made available 
only where it would help competition.   As the Commission  has long recognized, spectrum is “an 
essential input in the provision of mobile wireless services, and ensuring that sufficient spectrum 
is available for incumbent licensees as well as potential entrants is critical to promoting robust 
competition and inn ovation in the marketplace .”2  Chairwoman Rosenworcel reaffirmed the 
Commission’s commitment to these policies with its September 2023 Public Notice  seeking 
comment on, among other things, modernizing  spectrum aggregation policies to foster 5G 
competition.3   
Non-incumbent carriers ( more specifically, every carrier other than AT&T , T-Mobile , 
and Verizon) should have a “right of first refusal”  to all Inventory Spectrum.  The Commission

 should make this spectrum available to non- incumbent carriers through its Special Temporary 
Authority ( “STA ”) mechanism for no fee .4  Precedent exists for doing so, as a ll three incumbent 
carriers received free access to inventory spectrum at various points in the past four years .5  The 
time has come to give other, l ess-resourced carriers a fair c hance to get the same benefit.  
Specifically, Inventory S pectrum should be offered on a market -wide basis  for a time -
period of at least 36 months.  For example, 600 MHz Inventory Spectrum should be made 
available to a carrier  under STA for an entire Partial Economic Area  (“PEA”) .  This will give 
non-incumbent  carriers a predictable timeline to make use of the spectrum to benefit their 
customers.  Only in the event that no non- incumbent  carrier wants to or could use specific 
Inventory Spectrum should the dominant incumbents be able to apply to use it.  And given their 
years of free use from 2020 to the present of some of that same Inventory Spectrum , the 
dominant carriers should only be able to a ccess the spectrum under a six-month lease from the 
government, with a fee payment to the U.S. Treasury.6

 III. The Mobile Spectrum Holdings Policies Should Apply for All Inventory Spectrum 
Transactions  
Because limits on spectrum accumulation are necessary to promote competition , any 
Invent ory Spectrum transaction  (whether an STA or a lease)  should be subject to the 
Commission’s Mobile Spectrum Holdings policies.7  As DISH has recommended :8  
• The Commission should establish a national screen of 25%.   
• The Commission should confirm the below -1 GHz spectrum screen in light of that 
spectrum’s unique coverage and penetration characteristics, set it at 25% as well, and likewise rule that exceedance of that screen creates a rebuttable presumption of denial.   
• The Commission should create a rebuttable presumption of denial for the overall local market screen and set it at 25% as well.   
• The Commission should tackle the problem of strategic acquisitions of spectrum that 
disrupt contiguity; when ordering divestitures to return a buyer’s portfolio to below the 
screen, it should also seek to require such divestitures as to eliminate strategic walls, such 
as the one built by T -Mobile in the middle of the 600 MHz band.   
• The Commission should view contiguity -blocking as an aggravating factor that makes 
spectrum concentration more harmful and that makes it harder to rebut the presumption.   
• The Commission should be particularly mindful of the “roll -up” strategy of incremental 
acquisitions that snowball into market domination.   
• The Commission should limit 600 MHz spectrum ownership to three 10 MHz channel 
blocks in each PEA . 
IV. 12 GHz Two- Way Fixed 5G Broadband Requires No Statutory Auction Authority  
The Commission should also authorize two -way higher power fixed 5G services in the 
12 GHz band.  As the 12 GHz Coalition has been advocating for years, the Commission can 
unleash 500 MHz of 5G -ready spectrum immediately, and has never needed auction authority

 to do so.   Substantial evidence in the record shows that fixed 5G services can provide 
broadband to tens of millions of Americans, while fully protecting existing non -geostationary 
orbit Fixed -Satellite Service and Direct Broadcast Satellite customers.  Time is of the essence.  
There is still time to incorporate fixed 5G as part of states’ upcoming Broadband, Equity, 
Access and Deployment deployments.  Given the loss of auction authority and the 
Commission’s clear desire to find creative solutions, empowering carriers to utilize the 12 GHz 
band is an obvious action to take immediately.   
V. Conclusion  
For the foregoing reason s, the Commission should put its Inventory Spectrum and 12 
GHz resources to work for the public interest.

 WISPA’s members make intensive use of licensed , unlicensed , and shared spectrum, WISPA is 
uniquely situated to both understand the necessity to protect incumbent licensees from harmful 
interference and to recognize opportunities to enable shared use of spectrum resources.  
Introduction 
The Commission’s auction authority served as its primary mechanism for resolving 
mutually exclusive applications for spectrum licenses for nearly thirty years.  However, this auction authority lapsed over a year ago and Congress has not yet restored  it.  T he Bureau 
therefore requests comment on alternative ways in which the Commission could, in the absence 
of auction authority, use its existing statutory authority to provide access to its inventory of 
unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed through the auction process (“Inventory Spectrum”) to fulfill its responsibility to make spectrum resources available for use in the public interest.
2   
When the Commission did have auction authority, however, there was generally no 
means for the public to access any of this Inventory Spectrum outside of the auction process, and thus much of this spectrum has continued to lay fallow for years or even decades.  WISPA therefore urges the Bureau to consider the approaches described in the Public Notice  not simply 
as “stop -gap” measures, but rather as long- term alternatives for enabling access to spectrum that 
would otherwise likely continue to lie fallow even after the Commission’s auction authority is restored.  It is in this spirit that WISPA provides its recommendations regarding two Inventory Spectrum bands identified in the Public Notice  as capable of supporting broadband services :  (1)

 the 12.2- 12.7 GHz band licensed for Multi- Channel Video and Data Distribution Service 
(“MVDDS”) , and (2) the 2.5 GHz band licensed for BRS/EBS services.3   
Discussion  
I. THE BUREAU SHOULD CONSIDER A DYNAMIC SPECTRUM SHARING 
APPROACH TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO INVENTORY SPECTRUM  IN THE 
12.2- 12.7 GHZ BAND  
The most appropriate mechanism  for making Inventory Spectrum in the 12.2- 12.7 GHz 
band (“12.2 GHz band”) available for public use –  both in the absence of auction authority and 
after auction authority is restored – is the  dynamic spectrum sharing approach WISPA proposed4 
in response to the Commission’s recent FNPRM  on “the potential to expand terrestrial fixed use 
or to permit unlicensed use in” the 12.2 GHz band.5  Specifically, WISPA urg ed the Commission 
to enable access to the 12.2 GHz band for fixed terrestrial use on a secondary, shared use basis 
through nationwide, non- exclusive licenses with individual links and operations coordinated 
through an Automated Frequency Coordination (“AFC”) system informed by incumbents to ensure that MVD DS licensees and Direct Broadcast Satellite (“DBS”) operators are protected 
from harmful interference.

Inventory Spectrum that the Bureau is evaluating through the Public Notice.  See  WISPA 12 GHz

(filed Sept. 29, 2023), at 2- 4.  Use of the term “AFC” here does not mean that it would follow the specific 
rules of the 6 GHz AFC, but would be tailored to the needs of the specific band.",2,WISPA_Comments_on_Auction_Inventory_Public_Notice_(WT_24-72).pdf,WISPA – THE ASSOCIATION FOR BROADBAND WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"4 
 As described in detail in WISPA’s filings in the 12.2 GHz docket, t he dynamic spectrum 
sharing approach that WISPA has proposed is the most effective way to expand terrestrial use of 
this spectrum throughout the country while protecting licensed operations  from harmful 
interference.7  This approach can be easily implemented for Inventory Spectrum as well, with 
use authorized on a secondary basis when and where incumbent licensees are not operating.  The AFC would simply treat the areas where Inventory Spectrum is available in the same way it 
would authorize opportunistic use under the AFC.  This model will provide greater access and 
more efficient , effective and expeditious use of the 12.2 GHz band than a model based on mutual 
exclusivity because it will enable many potential users to invest in the spectrum  without the need 
for auctioning unsold, returned or cancelled MVDDS license s, thus stimulating more immediate 
investment and innovation, including by small companies and entrepreneurs generally, consistent 
with the goals of Section 257 of Communications Act (as recodified in RAY BAUM’s Act).
8   
The dynamic sharing approach that WISPA has proposed for the 12.2 GHz band would 
not only protect incumbent operations but also would not require any changes to the existing primary service allocations or to the regulatory framework for existing licensed operations in 
these bands .
9  Existing licensees would maintain priority over shared use operations and would 
be able to continue to expand their provision of services within their licensed areas consistent with the rules currently applicable to their operations.  T his spectrum sharing framework can also

the public interest.”).

"5 
 facilitate access to this Inventory Spectrum in a shorter time frame than would be required under 
the much more complex processes necessary to fairly accommodate exclusive -use licensing in 
the absence of an auction mechanism , and would furthermore continue to enable more robust and 
effective use of this spectrum after auction authority is restored.  
Consistent with the rules and processes for the 6 GHz band, albeit with technical 
adjustments to account for the differences in frequency and incumbent use, the AFC system requirements for the 12.2 GHz band should also include Inventory Spectrum and be developed by industry stakeholders with approval  by the Commission following an appropriate testing 
period.
10  Accordingly, t here should be no concerns that the AFC system is unproven, unreliable, 
or unsecure, or that it will lack the functionality required to meet the twin goals of making fallow spectrum available for secondary fixed terrestrial operations and protecting incumbent s from 
harmful interference.  
II. THE BUREAU SHOULD CONSIDER AN “APPLICATION WINDOW” 
APPROACH TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO INVENTORY SPECTRUM IN THE 2.5 GHZ BAND  
In contrast to the 12.2 GHz band, the licensing and operating environment of the 2.5 GHz 
BRS/EBS band presents unique  challenges to a shared use approach such as dynamic spectrum 
sharing or non- exclusive site -based licensing, including the wide variety of license area sizes and 
variability of channel blocks within these areas resulting from the overlay of auctioned 2.5 GHz 
licenses on pre -auction BRS/EBS licenses, as well as the use of the 2.5 GHz band for both fixed 
and mobile operations.  In light of thes e challenges, the Bureau should consider other options for 
providing access to the Inventory Spectrum in this band.
11   
 
10 Public Notice  at ¶ 8.  These AFC system requirements are described in more detail in the WISPA  12 
GHz Comments and the WISPA 12 GHz Reply Comments.  
11 See Public Notice  at ¶ 12 (requesting comment on other assignment options).",4,WISPA_Comments_on_Auction_Inventory_Public_Notice_(WT_24-72).pdf,WISPA – THE ASSOCIATION FOR BROADBAND WITHOUT BOUNDARIES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"6 
 Specifically, the most appropriate option for making Inventory Spectrum in the 2.5 GHz 
band available to the public would be for the Commission to establish application windows 
during which potential users of this spectrum would be invited to submit applications to obtain exclusive licenses for unassigned 2.5 GHz spectrum.  If the Commission receives only one application for the unassigned spectrum in a given area, the applicant would then be assigned a permanent license for that spectrum.
12  In cases where two or more mutually exclusive 
applications are submitted for the unassigned spectrum in a given area, the Commission can use 
its statutory authority under 47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(6)(E) to require the applicants to resolve the 
mutual exclusivity through a negotiated settlement that would serve as the basis for the issuance of permanent licenses.
13  In either case, the permanent licenses granted under this approach 
would be subject to the buildout requirements of Section 27.14(u) of the Commission’s Rules14 
as well as all other technical and operating rules applicable to EBS licenses for licenses initially 
issued after October 25, 2019, including those related to the protection of incumbent licensees in 
the band.  
III. THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO 
INVENTORY SPECTRUM THROUGH SPECIAL TEMPORARY AUTHORITY 
Regardless of which approaches or frameworks may be considered or adopted for 
particular bands, the Commission should continue to provide the public with access to Inventory 
Spectrum through the grant of Special Temporary Authority (“STA”).15  As noted in the Public 
 
12 WISPA recommends county -based licenses using the same channel blocks that were auctioned in 
Auction 108.  
13 47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(6)(E) (preserving the Commission’s authority “to continue to use engineering 
solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service regulations, and other means in order to avoid 
mutual exclusivity in application and licensing procee dings.”).   
14 47 C.F.R. § 27.14(u).

"7 
 Notice , the grant of STA allows the use of spectrum under limited circumstances and for limited 
purposes on a secondary, non-interfering basis.16  The Communications Act limits the term of a 
grant of STA to a maximum of 180 days, which can be extended for additional periods not to 
exceed 180 days.17  Despite these limitations, the use of STA to provide access to Inventory 
Spectrum has been effective in certain specific circumstances , such as the 5.9 GHz band to 
expand bandwidth capacity, and thus remains a viable option.  Nevertheless, these same limitations mean that STA cannot and should not be looked to or relied upon as the only, or even one of the primary, means for providing access to Inventory Spectrum.  
Conclusion 
 For all of the foregoing reasons, WISPA urges the Bureau to consider alternative means 
to facilitate access to Inventory Spectrum consistent with the recommendations expressed above.

COMMENTS OF THE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE  
 
 
The Dynamic Spectrum Alliance (“DSA”)1 hereby submits these comments in response 
to the Federal Communications Commission ’s (“FCC”  or “the Commission” ) Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau (“WTB”) Public Notice  (“PN”) in the above captioned proceeding 
in which it seeks comments on how  to “make spectrum resources available for use in the public 
interest, in light of the ongoing  lapse of the Commission’s auction authority .”2

One of DSA’s primary goals is to increase spectrum access through shared and more 
efficient use .  Achieve ment of  this goal is possible through  the introduction of  dynamic shared 
access  – either using  an automated Dynamic Spectrum Management S ystem  (“DSMS”)3 that 
actively manages new entrants ’ access to maximize use of spectrum while ensuring protection of 
incumbents  and facilitating coexistence among new users , or through a carefully crafted set of 
rules that allow new unlicensed or licensed -by-rule operations  under specific circumstance s and 
operating parameters .  As the Commission looks to solve challenges with the  deployment of 
advanced  wireless services across the country  and ensure valuable spectrum is not sitting fallow , 
dynamic shared access can enable higher -capacity and lower -cost deployments  in both urban and 
rural underserved areas  and streamline access to spectrum that has been under -utilized . 
In the  PN, the Commission  identifies three broad approaches to  make unassigned 
spectrum (“ Inventory Spectrum ”) available for public use in the absence of auction authority , 
namely:  1) dynamic spectrum sharing techniques , 2) non -exclusive site -based licensing , and 3 ) 
leasing.4  The DSA believe s that the first option is preferrable and recommends that the 
Commission adopt  a license -by-rule framework similar to the successful Citizens Broadband 
Radio Service (“CBRS”) General Authorized Access (“GAA”) tier, together with a light -touch

The DSA’s members have extensive experience in the development and implementation 
of innovative, non -exclusive licensing frameworks, supported by automated dynamic spectrum 
sharing solutions, including in the TV White Spaces, 3.5 GHz CBRS, and 6 GHz bands .  We 
believe that the experience gained from these shared bands  can be tailored to meet the specific 
opportunities and challenges  of putting  Inventory Spectrum  to use , including minimiz ing harmful 
interference and promot ing coexistence  between and among va rious spectrum users .   
The DSA believes that t he introduction of new , non -exclusive  licensing options 
supported by automated DSMS technology  to coordinate specific deployment sites  is the best 
path to support increas ed spectrum access and intensive use by a wide range of new users , which 
will in turn  lead to more rapid deployment of new networks , services , and innovative business 
models .  At its core, an  automated DSMS  is a software -based embodiment of the Commission’s 
rules  for protecting incumbents  and facilitating coordination among users  while enabling broader 
access  and more intensive use .  Automate d dynamic spectrum sharing lower s transaction costs, 
uses spectrum more efficiently, speed s time-to-market for new services, protect s incumbents 
from interference with greater certainty, and generally expand s the supply of wireless 
connectivity that is fast becoming, like electricity, a critical input for other industries and 
economic activity.5

The experience the Commission and industry have gained from implementing innovative 
licensing frameworks supported by automated DSMS solutions  should be  applied to the 
challenges of enabling access to Inventory Spectrum .  For example, sharing between CBRS  
operations  in the 3.5 GHz band under the Commission’s Part 96 rules is relevant  for the 
protection of existing licensed services in bands where Inventory Spectrum is available .  From a n 
interference management perspective , there have been no reports of interference  by co-channel 
or adjacent incumbents since the commercial launch of CBRS service s, which demonstrates that 
automated DSMS  tools can effectively enforce protection of certain users while also enabling 
new entrants into a band .   
Likewise, f rom the perspective of increasing access to spectrum by a wide range of non -
exclusive users, the CBRS experience is relevant.  T here are more than 370,000 CBRS devices 
(CBSDs)  deployed  by more than 1,200 different  entities  under , most of wh om operat e using the 
opportunistic access CBRS GAA tier .  This unprecedented growth , which shows no sign of 
abating,  demonstrates that t he Commission’s license -by-rule framework , supported by automated 
spectrum management tools, lowers barriers to entry, reduces spectrum acquisition costs, speed s 
time-to-market for new service s, and  results in more intensive and efficient spectrum usage than 
do exclusive licensing or legacy manual coordination approaches.  
With regard to the other approaches proposed in the PN,  the DSA notes that both the  non-
exclusive site -based licensing  framework  and leasing of Inventory Spectrum options could lead 
to spectrum warehousing  in the absence of build -out requirements , the creat ion of  barriers to 
entry for smaller operators and users , and ongoing administrative burdens for the Commission",3,DSA Comments to FCC PN on Inventory Spectrum.pdf,THE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

and users alike .  Leasing could result in the exclusion of smaller and rural operators if pricing  is 
based on exclusive use of large geographic area s (as most of these Inventory Spectrum licenses 
are currently configured).  Moreover, with respect to the Commission’s lapsed auction authority, 
the leasing option creates a design dilemma since a lease offer (e.g., a reserve price) could attract 
mutually e xclusive applications.  Presumably the Commission could not respond to interest from 
more than one operator by raising the price since that would be tantamount to conducting an 
auction.  Mitigating this d ilemma by setting very high leasing prices would further exacerbate 
the exclusion of the sort of smaller and rural operators and enterprises who could otherwise gain 
access to the spectrum if it were made available through a coordinated sharing mechanism.  
For all of these reasons, the DSA reiterates its preference for a  license -by-rule framework 
supported by proven DSMS tools that can be adapted to the unique challenges of various 
Inventory Spectrum bands.   The DSA is also supportive of the concept of experimental 
innovation zones where users could experiment with different technical  approaches  and dynamic 
spectrum sharing techniques  to maximize efficient use and streamline access.  
 
Conclusion  
 The DSA  appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Commission ’s NPRM  exploring 
ways to increase access and efficient use of Inventory Spectrum to promote the deployment of 
advanced  wireless services across the country .  The DSA and its members have extensive 
experience in implementing innovative licensing frameworks , such as the CBRS license -by-rule 
model, supported by automated DSMS tools .  This combination lower s barriers to entry , results",4,DSA Comments to FCC PN on Inventory Spectrum.pdf,THE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ALLIANCE,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

OF THE

Th
e Enterpr ise Wireless Alliance ( “EWA ”) shares the concern of the Federal 
Communications Commission ( “FCC”) about the lapse of its auction authority.  Spectrum 
auction s have been an effective, efficient mea ns of assigning significant amounts of wireless 
spectrum for commercial use that avoid the problem of mutual exclusivity.  EWA supports the 
efforts of the FCC and others that seek restoration of that authority as promptly as possible.  In 
its absence, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau ( “WTB ”) requests  comment s on how its 
existing regulatory tools could be used to allow access to unassigned, auctionable spectrum so 
it can be deployed to serve  the public interest  while avoiding instances of m utual exclusivity .1 
The Public Notice identifies several suc h bands where spectrum either was not acquired at 
auction or was returned to the FCC  after the fact  (“Inventory Spectrum ”).  It classifies  them as 
bands capable of supporting broadband services and as those that support narrowband 
services.2   
 The Public Notice suggests several appro aches  for consideration  as auction 
alternatives :  dynamic spectrum sharing, non- exclusive site -based licensing, leasing spectrum

 inventory licenses, and spe cial temp orary authority ( “STA ”).  The Comments filed in this 
proceeding may offer useful recommendations as to these and other means for allowing access 
to broadband spectrum.  EWA submits that applications f or narrowband/wideband Inventory 
Spectrum, specifically services  authorized under 47 C.F.R. §§ 22.503 (V HF/UHF Paging), 
90.601 et seq . (SMR), 90.701 et seq. (220 MHz) , 80.475 et seq . (AMTS ), 95.1901 et seq . (218-
219 MHz), and any other bands deemed appropriate by the FCC, could be coordinated on an 
exclusive, co unty-defined basis by current  FCC -certified Frequency Advisory Committees 
(“FACs ”)3 with decades of experience in and with  proven processes for handling such requests 
while avoidin g mutual exclusivity .  For th e reasons discussed  below, EWA recommends that 
the approach proposed herein be used for these services even  after the FCC ’s auction authority 
is restored.   
The migration of many users from conventional to trunked systems and from analog to 
digital technology has made exclusive spectrum as signments as important for  
narrowb and/wideband systems as they are for commercial b roadband operations .  Even “ site-
based ” licensing in the Part 90 services often is based on contour analyses defining protected 
service areas, effectively creating  exclusive channel assignments.4  Such app lications are 
processed routinely on a first -in-time basis , with FACs exchanging information about  proposed 
channel  assignments to resolve what would other wise be situations of mutual exclusivity  
before applications are submi tted to the FCC.  
The challenge is  processing requests in response to the opening of a filing window 
when multiple  applications for the same spectrum in the same geographic area are expected , a 
situation without a natural “ first-in-time” queue that typically triggers mutual exclusivity .  This

 situation has arisen several time s in recent years in Part 90 spectrum , and the FACs , with the 
approval of the WTB , have adopte d a process for addressing it.  In summary, t hey utilize a 
neutral third party as a “host” for applicati ons submitted by indivi dual F ACs no earlier  than a 
specific deadline, which host assigns them a queue ranking in time -stamp order.  The 
applications then are processed by the submitting FAC and filed with  the FCC in that time -
stamp order to the extent s pectrum consistent with the application is  available .5  The FACs 
agree in advance on several parameters such as the number of channels assignable to an  
application and the number of applications an entity may submit within a defined area.  This 
system was use d for the processing of Part 90 “ central station ” channels ,6 for 470-512 MHz 
(“T-B and”) channels after the T -Band freeze was  lifted,7 and for post-rebanding 800 MHz 
Sprint- Vacated, Expansion Band, and Guard Band channels.8  All participating FACs followed 
the agreed -upon procedures. The FCC was not  required to resolve any instances of mutual 
exclusivity or other disputes.  Spectrum was made available to qualified applicants and placed 
into productive use expeditiously.   
EWA recommends that the same  process be used to assign Inventory Spectrum from 
the bands/service iden tified above and other spectrum identified  by the FCC.  It would promote 
prompt and efficient spect rum u tilization and, in the FCC ’s words, “ ensure a level playing 
field, prevent harmful interference, and prom ote co -existence among spectrum users.”9  To 
simplify the licensing process and make the spectrum attractive for the business, industrial,

 governmental, and small commer cial systems for wh ich narrowband/wideband channels are  
well-suited , EWA recommen ds that the  geographic licensing scheme  in each band be modified 
to provide for assignment by count y with the same adjacent market protection criteri on as is in 
place today.   There would be no impact on co- channel or adjacent channel systems.  Similarly, 
adoption of this approach would ha ve no impact on the FCC ’s Mobile Spectrum Holdings 
polici es, as these bands are not included in those analyses  but would incentivize investment in 
and use of this long- vacant spectrum . 
In fact, allowing FACs to manage the assignment of this spectrum in this well- tested 
proce ss promises the most e xpeditious use of t his spectrum  and should be retained when the 
FCC ’s auction authority has been reinstated.  The re are multiple bands where auctions will 
remain the most efficient wa y to allocate spectrum reso urces.   This is particularly the case with 
mid-band and high- band allocations where broadband licenses are issued  and where 
commercial deploymen t has been delayed in the absence of auction  authority.  The 
narrowband/wideband allocations , comparable to allocations where FAC s have long m anaged 
the frequency recommendation  process , are not likely to be high on the FCC ’s auction priority 
list once th at auth ority has been reinstated.  The most recent auction of inventoried spectrum in 
any of the bands proposed herein was more than a decade ago in Auction #95 for VHF/UHF 
paging spectrum.  The Inventory Spectrum in other bands has been unavailable since 2003 and 
2007.  If it is ever to be placed into product ive use, that is much more likely to occur in a  
WTB -approved, FAC -implemented  process that has work ed efficiently for comparable 
spectrum in similar situations.   
The Public Notice does  not seek comment on the economic implications to the U.S. 
Treasury of assigning Inventory Spectrum other  than through auctions.  A review of the 
revenue generated in the past from auctions of the narrowband/wideband spectrum in t his",3,EWA Comments re Auction Alternatives -  WT 24-72 - 4-8-24.pdf,EWA - The Enterprise Wireless Alliance ,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"5 
 
proposal suggests that the impact would be nominal.  That revenue was never significant even 
when the auctioned licenses covered major population areas, which is not likely to be the case 
for the Inventory Spe ctrum.  However, the FCC may want to consider  what regulatory and/or 
processing fees would be appropriate should the approach proposed herein be adopted. 
The attached Memorandum of Agreement , subject to modifications deemed appropriate 
by the FCC, could be used to determine which FACs wish to participate in the processing of 
Inventory Spectrum consistent with the queueing process agreed to by the FACs.   
EWA  looks forward to working with the  FCC and with other FACs in  making this long 
dormant Inventory Spectrum available to qualified applicants.

Spectrum”) held by the FCC , authorized under 47 C.F.R. §§ 22.503, 90.701 et seq ., 
80.475 et seq ., 95.1901 et seq ., and any other bands deemed appropriate by the FCC .  
 
2. AUTHORITY.    
 
This Agreement is authorized under the provisions of 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.131(m) and 0.331, 
which delegate authority to the Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to enter 
into written agreements certifying frequency coordinators  and to engage in oversight 
of coordinator actions and practices.  
  
3.    PURPOSE.    
The purpose of this Agreement is to designate FACs  to provide eligible entities  with 
access to Inventory  Spectrum in bands previously auctioned for use in wireless 
systems .  Pursuant to this MOU , the participating FACs w ill develop a process to allow  
Inventory Spectrum to be  assigned in an equitable manner without mutual exclusivity, 
and to be utilized efficiently and in accordance with all applicable FCC rules, regulation s, and policies.  This Agreement defines the scope, t erms, conditio ns, and 
requirements of the authority delegated to the FACs.  Because the FCC will retain oversight over the spectrum recommendation  activities described herein and because 
all determinations regarding any required issuance, modification , or termination of an 
FCC license will be made by the FCC, the delegation of these activities is fully compliant with the “private nondelegation doctrine.” Boerschig,  872 F.3 at 707.",6,EWA Comments re Auction Alternatives -  WT 24-72 - 4-8-24.pdf,EWA - The Enterprise Wireless Alliance ,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

COMMENTS OF NCTA – THE INTERNET & TELEVISION ASSOCIATION 
NCTA – The Internet & Television Association ( “NCTA ”) supports the Federal 
Communications Commission’s (“Commission”) consideration of non-auction mechanisms to 
accelerate commercial access to the inventory of unassigned spectrum in bands previously 
licensed for wireless services through auctions (“inventor y spectrum”) .  Although a uthority to 
auction spectrum is critical for the Commission , and NCTA supports efforts to restore this 
authority as quickly as possible , NCTA also applauds the Commission ’s efforts  to consider all 
options to make spectrum available for commercial use.  The Public Notice  in the above -
referenced docket  correctly recognizes that spectrum is a valuable and scarce resource .1  
Unprecedented and growing consumer demand for advanced spectr um-based services requires  
the Commission to maximize commercial spectrum availability through a variety of spectrum 
access frameworks, like the coexistence mechanisms identified in the Public Notice .2

 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
In addition to  supporting  the Commission ’s efforts to make use of inventory spectrum , 
NCTA encourages the Commission to consider and prioritize  coexistence-based spectrum access 
frameworks in all proceedings that propose to make new  commercial  spectrum available,  in 
order to promote competition, innovation, and efficiency.3  The Commission can achieve this  
objective  regardless of its  Congressional authority to conduct spectrum auctions , and doing so 
best serves  the public interest.  
The Commission’s use of  diverse spectrum access frameworks enables  efficient spectrum 
use that benefits a  wide array of users and use cases.  Coexistence -based spectrum access 
frameworks are increasingly vital to U.S. spectrum policy  as demand for this finite resource 
continues t o grow .  To ensure innovation and competition domestically and internationally , 
NCTA encourages the Commission to adopt coexistence frameworks as promptly as possible in 
the Lower 3 GHz, 7 GHz, Lower 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands , which are ripe for action an d can 
deliver significant near -term economic  and consumer  benefits . 
I. A DIVERSE SET OF SPECTRUM ACCESS FRAMEWORKS WILL  MAXIMIZE 
SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY TO BENEFIT THE WIDEST VARIETY OF USERS  
AND USE CASES . 
To meet intensifying spectrum demand,  NCTA encourages the Commission to use 
diverse spectrum access frameworks, prioritizing coexistence  where ver feasible.  Such a policy  
would facilitate  spectrum availab ility for  a wide r variety of users and use cases  and would make 
spectrum available for com mercial use more rapidly than exclusively  licensed frameworks.

stating that the Commission will seek meaningful comment on licensed -shared and unlicensed 
spectrum access frameworks in all new proceedings th at propose to make new commercial 
spectrum available”) .",3,NCTA Comments on Inventory Spectrum Access PN (24-72).pdf,NCTA – THE INTERNET & TELEVISION ASSOCIATION,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 American businesses and consumers would benefit from increased competition and innovation as 
a result.   
A. Growing spectrum demand and scarce spectrum resources necessitate more 
extensive use of coexistence-based spectrum access frameworks.  
As American life and work become more connected, coexistence -based frameworks play 
an increasingly essential  role in meeting unprecedented spectrum demand .  In the U.S. alone, 2.3 
billion devices  are connected to Wi -Fi networks.4  It is therefore  unsurprising that technologies 
relying on Wi -Fi and unlicensed spectrum account for more than half of all U.S. inter net traffic ,5 
and more than 85 percent of cable operators’ mobile data.6  In contrast, only 6.6 percent of U.S. 
internet traffic is carried over licensed wireless spectrum.7  
Appetite for spectrum -based services, and the corresponding need for additiona l 
commercial spectrum, continues  to grow .  The National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (“ NTIA ”) has recognized that “[t]here is more demand for this finite resource 
than ever before.”8  But traditional spectrum reallocation alone, “which often take[s] too long 
and cost[s] too much money,” cannot meet this demand.9  To support this evolution, the 
Commission must rely on diverse spectrum access frameworks  and use coexistence-based 
spectrum access frameworks  where ver feasible , including licensed -shared and unlicensed

 frameworks , in order to meet the needs of the widest possible array of American businesses and 
consumers  and support  robust economic growth.  
B. Coexistence-based spectrum access frameworks  enable  domestic and 
international innovation and competition.  
Coexistence-based spectrum access frameworks enable innovation and competition in the 
provision of spectrum -based services  in myriad ways.  Importantly, coexistence -based 
frameworks produce these benefits without the  need for ti me-consuming and costly incumbent 
relocation .  This makes  spectrum  available to new entrants and other competitors and innovators 
more rapidly and efficiently than exclusive ly licensed  framework s.  For example, the three -tiered 
licensed -shared model employed in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) band  made 
new spectrum available for commercial use via sharing with incumbent f ederal  users rather than 
attempting a long process to clear or relocate them .10  And the  Commission’s  2020  6 GHz Order 
opening the entire 6 GHz band (5.925 -7.125 GHz) for unlicensed use accelerated the growth of 
advanced Wi -Fi.11  Within three years , the 6 GHz Order enabled  more than 1,200 Wi -Fi 6E 
products to enter the market place,12 and more than 473 million Wi-Fi 6E devices were  expected 
to ship in 2023 alone .13

 Coexistence frameworks  also fuel innovation and competition by enabl ing tailor ed 
spectrum use  without reliance on nationwide wireless carriers.14  Wi-Fi, a powerful source of 
uniquely American innovation that would not have been possible without the Commission’s 
support for unlicensed frameworks , is a vital mode of connectivity for  American businesses and 
consumers : over half of all U.S. and global internet traffic is delivered over Wi-Fi, and Wi -Fi 
now carries more than 85 percent of U.S. cable operators’ mobile data traffic.15  Current 
forecasts predict the economic value of Wi -Fi in the U.S. will reach nearly $1.4 trillion by 2025, 
without considering Wi -Fi 6E and the 6 GHz band allocation.16  Accounting for Wi -Fi 6E and 6 
GHz adds $187.4 billion in predicted economic growth.17 
The lower power limits and county -based  sizes  of licensed -shared P riority Access 
Licenses  (“PALs”)  in the CBRS band have allowed new entrants and non -traditional licensees to 
 
14 Licensed -exclusive frameworks with large geographic license sizes and high -power  levels 
primarily benefit only  the largest wireless carriers, to the detriment of American businesses, 
consumers, and competition.  See Marguerite Reardon, Verizon, AT&T and T -Mobile dominate

 offer innovative services .  For example, cable providers have used CBRS licenses to provide a 
private network in the Wells Fargo Center in Philadel phia18 and connect low -income Mesa 
Public Schools students at home .19  CBRS also is being used to automate factories, increase 
agricultural efficiency, and enhance consumer experiences and monitor critical infrastructure at 
airports.20  In addition to supporting private networks, CBRS spectrum offers cable providers 
another option for offloading outdoor traffic to support their developing mobile service offerings .
21 
 Coexistence framewor ks also reinforce  U.S. technological leadership on a  global scale by 
elevating the visibility of  American innovations in  Wi-Fi and CBRS -style sharing .  Through 
state-sponsored companies like Huawei and ZTE , China dominates the global marketplace for 
equipment  that supports exclusively -licensed 5G network s.22  Over -reliance on the exclusive 
licensing frameworks favored by nationwide wireless carriers therefore would frustrate U.S.  
technological leadership .  The Commission ’s use of diverse  coexistence-based spectrum access 
frameworks  where ver feasible  would by contrast  contribute to the global proliferation of 
American innovations in  coexistence technologies and  would benefit U.S. economic 
competitiveness .

RIPE FOR ADOPTION OF LICENSED -SHARED AND UNLICENSED 
FRAMEWORK S. 
The Lower 3 GHz, 7 GHz, Lower 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands are perfectly situated –  
both spectrally and technologically  – for prompt adoption of licensed -shared and unlicensed 
spectrum access framework s.  A coexistence -based  approach in each band w ould allow for 
efficient and cost -effective  spectrum use by a diverse set of users , offer the fastest method of 
putting this spectrum in the hands of businesses and consumers , and enable  federal and non -
federal incumbents to continue providing critical services  without disruption .  NCTA therefore 
encourages the Commission to adopt  licensed -shared and unlicensed spectrum access 
frameworks  in these  band s.23 
A. Lower 3 GHz Band.  
The Lower 3 GHz band (3.1-3.45 GHz)  is of critical importance not only to cable 
operators providing competitive wireless broadband services  but also to expand ing low-power 
targeted deployments across the U.S.  for manufacturing, agriculture, education, energy, and 
Tribal lands.  The Lower 3 GHz band is especially  important to cable providers ’ ability to 
provide competitive options to consumers  and is not  fungible with other spectrum due to its 
proximity to the CBRS band, where cable operators have already invested heavily .

 Opening this band to licensed -shared use does not require studying next-generation 
coexistence technologies  anew.  R ather , the CBRS band’s coexistence approach  can form the 
basis for the spectrum access approach  in the Lower 3 GHz band .  And the Commission  could 
authorize a licensed -shared approach akin to General Authorized Access until auction authority 
is renewed, at which time the Commission could establish an auction for licenses similar to  
PALs in the CBRS  band.  
As NCTA has previously explained, the t wo-year, multi-stakeholder study conducted by 
the Partnering to Advance Trusted and Holistic Spectrum Solutions task group also can inform 
the Interagency Spectrum Advisory process  and has the potential to expedite the study period set 
forth in  the NSS Implementation Plan, which is not scheduled to conclude until October 2026.24  
Among other benefits, a  licensed -shared approach in the Lower 3 GHz band would avoid a 
years -long relocation process that would cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars  and 
interrupt sensitive government operations ,25 not to mention  the $41  billion net loss to the U.S. 
economy that economists have  associated with a potential licensed -exclusive framewor k.26  
B. 7 GHz Band.  
The 7 GHz band (7.125-8.4  GHz) is the best near -term opportunity for growth in 
unlicensed spectrum given  its proximity to the 6 GHz band.   Unlicensed sharing in  the 7 GHz

 band would enable commercial use of  vital spectrum resources without compromising, 
displacing, disrupting, or incurring exorbitant costs for federal incumbents , including the 
Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration .  Unlicensed sharing in the 7 GHz band also would  not only complete a  stranded  
320-megahertz channel at the top of the unlicensed 6 GHz band  but also create the opportunity 
for additional 320 -megahertz channels , which has the potential to  quickly unleash more gigabit 
Wi-Fi cap acity for American businesses and consumers .27  Furthermore,  an unlicensed regime in 
the 7 GHz band may be possible  without the need to  relocat e federal incumbent users , meaning 
consumers could experience the benefits of expanded access much sooner than exclusively  
licensed  spectrum could be put to use ( which  likely would not be until 2030 at the earliest).28 
The Lower 7 GHz band (7.125-7.250 GHz)  is best situated for qu ick action to enable 
commercial unlicensed use,  and the 7.250 -8.4 GHz  frequency range  offers compelling 
opportunities for more expansive unlicensed and possibly shared-licensed coexistence 
frameworks  after additional study .  Notably , unlicensed Wi-Fi chips can already support 
frequencies up to 7.625 GHz .  Access to these frequencies  would enable  densification of Internet 
of Things networks  and establish a robust  unlicensed spectrum pipeline that can  keep pace with 
high-speed broadband networks and consumer demands .  Given the complexity of incumbent 
operations between  7125 and 8400  MHz, unlicensed and licensed -shared  frameworks can most 
rapidly expand access and unleash economic growth without the need for extensive  clearing .  
 
27 Existing Wi-Fi technology safely co -exists with federal and non -federal incumbents in other 
bands , and existing radios can be upgraded to operate on 7 GHz frequencies.  Because current 
Wi-Fi standards are based on 320 -megahertz ch annels, this would allow consumers to quickly 
realize the benefits of greater efficiency and increased throughput for data-intensive applications.

 C. Lower 37 GHz Band.  
The Lower 37 GHz band (37.0-37.6 GHz) also is well -suited for licensed -shared use.29  
NCTA appreciates the Commission ’s and NTIA’s work to “implement a co-equal, shared -use 
framework” for the Lower 37 GHz band,30 and NCTA further supports the Commission’s 
adoption of a framework that utilizes non -exclusive, nationwide licenses with uniform, 100 -
megahertz channels, subject to coordination and the power and emissions limits used in the 
Upper 37 GHz band (37.6 -38.6 G Hz).  Coordination could be accomplished via a third -party 
database administrator, which would register each licensee’s base stations and verify non -
interference with f ederal users in the Lower 37 GHz band.  Given the expedited timeline 
contemplated for th e Lower 37 GHz band and the status of the existing record, the Commission 
is well-positioned to act expeditiously.31 
D. 12.7 GHz Band.  
A licensed -shared framework in the 12.7  GHz band (12. 7-13.25 GHz) could be 
implemented quickly to  support  innovation and investment.  Such a framework, including 
county-sized licenses and 50 -megahertz channel blocks, would safeguard existing users in the 
band while enabling more efficient spectrum use without the need to relocate incumbents .32  
Although it is  not a  substitute for  lower -frequenc y spectrum , licensed -shared use of the 12.7 GHz 
band can foster  competition , innovation, and diversity of uses and users .

 CONCLUSION 
NCTA supports the Commission’s consideration of non -auction  mechanisms to provid e 
the public with access to inventory spectrum  and encourages  recogni tion of these mechanisms ’ 
inherent value , regardless of the Commission’s auction authority.  As our nation’s  spectrum 
demands continue to grow, NCTA  encourage s the Commission to (1) use  diverse spectrum 
access frameworks , including coexistence frameworks where ver feasible, to maximize spectral 
efficiency and availability  of spectrum  to the widest possible array of American businesses and 
consumers ; and (2) adopt coexistence frameworks as promptly as possible in the Lower 3 GHz, 7 
GHz, Lower 37 GHz, and 12.7 GHz bands .

      COMMENTS OF CTIA 
CTIA1 respectfully submits these comments in response to the  Public Notice  seeking 
comment on regulatory tools the Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”)  could 
use to enable  access to its inventory of currently unassigned spectrum in bands previously 
licensed for wireless services through auctions  (“Inventory Spectrum”) .2 
I. INTRODUCTION.  
CTIA wholeheartedly agrees with Chairwoman Rosenworcel that spectrum auctions “are 
a big reason why the United States leads the world in wireless innovation” and are “an essential 
part of our economic and national security.”3  As the Public Notice highlights, “auctions have 
been the most effective mechanism to resolve mutually exclusive applications for geographic -
area licenses in a manner that yields the most benefits to the public .”4  
It is critical for Congress to renew  the Commission’s authority to auction spectrum.  Last 
month marked the one -year anniversary of the expiration of auction authority—the first such

"2 lapse since Congress authorized competitive bidding for spectrum licenses more than three 
decades ago.5  This absence of Congressional action has stymied the ability of  industry and the 
Commission to leverage proven mechanisms for America’s continued wireless success.6  
We appreciate the Commission’s interest in moving I nventory S pectrum into the 
market place.  In doing so, the Commission should retain  its commitment to an exclusive -use, 
flexible -rights licensing framework for the Inventory Spectrum bands.  It should continue to call 
on Congress to renew its auction authority.  To the extent the Commission looks to open its 
Inventory S pectrum in the near term, it should rely on existing  mechanisms  to enable access 
consistent with band- specific technical rules  until auction authority is restored and the 
Commission can auction the Inventory Spectrum .7  The C ommission should not pursue dynamic 
spectrum  sharing or site -based licensing for its Inventory Spectrum , as such mechanism s would 
take longer to stand up and deploy than regaining auction authority, with a much smaller 
addressable market place,  raising  significant implementation questions . 
II. SPECTRUM  AUCTIONS ARE A PROVEN WAY TO DRIVE COMPETITION 
AND PROMOTE EFFICIENT SPECTRUM USE . 
Thirty years ago, the U.S. set itself on a path to becoming the global  leader in wireless 
when Congress authorized the Commission to conduct competitive bidding to assign  spectrum 
licenses.8  This mechanism has led to massive investment and innovation in wireless networks 
and the wireless ecosystem, delivered widespread competition for wireless services and

"3 increasingly for home broadband, and produced myriad benefits for consumers, businesses, and 
enterprise users across the country.9  Spectrum auctions have been lauded on a bipartisan basis , 
including in calls to renew  the Commission’s auction authority.10  And they have  garnered both 
Nobel Prize and Emmy Award accolades for those most directly involved in the Commission’s  
execution  of its spectrum auction authority.11 
Auctions drive market -based competition, ensuring spectrum is allocated to its highest 
use while encouraging providers to invest billions each year to build and improve  the world’s 
most robust wireless networks.  The market realities  facing the commercial wireless industry —
namely, the competitive auction process and a competitive secondary market —have driven 
providers to pursue dramatic increases in spectrum efficiency , with providers increasing their 
spectrum efficiency by a factor of 42 during the 4G decade  on a MB/MHz basis .12  As data 
demands increase,13 wireless license holders  have continued to make considerable investments in 
technology advancements that improve spectrum utilization.14  Wireless licensees can also react 
to competitive pressures by leasing  or selling their  licenses , resulting in further efficiencies .15

"4 The Commission’s spectrum auctions have supported market place access for nationwide, 
regional, and rural providers, cable companies, small and minority- owned business, and 
enterprises alike.16  As the Congressional Research Service found, “[b]y awarding licenses to the 
highest bidders from a diverse pool and including buildout requirements as a condition of 
licensing, the [Commission]  could ensure that spectrum -holders were ready and able to use the 
spectrum, provide services to consumers in all areas, and enhance competition.”17 
Further , the more than 100 auctions conducted since the Commission first obtained this 
authority have raised more than $230 billion both for the U.S. Treasury and to support a variety 
of government programs and the modernization of national defense systems.18  This substantial 
investment is in addition to the more than $675 billion the wireless industry has invested into its 
networks over the history of the industry.19 
Other countries have taken notice of the benefits of spectrum auctions.  Since 1994 when 
the Commission conducted the first spectrum auction, more than 100 countries have used 
auctions to allocate spectrum for wireless use.  In the past year alone, other countries have 
auctioned more than 4,600 megahertz of spectrum while the U.S. sits on the sidelines.20 
Securing our innovation leadership and enhancing our global economic competitiveness 
requires that Congress act swiftly to restore the Commission’s auction authority and give the 
agency the tools it needs to promote America’s continued wireless leadership .

"5 III. FULL -POWER  LICENSES DRIVE U.S. ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL 
SECURITY BENEFITS BY ENABLING PREDICTABLE, ASSURED ACCESS 
TO DRIVE THE INVESTMENT NEEDED FOR WIDE -AREA DEPLOYMENT . 
A strong pipeline of licensed full -power, flexible -rights spectrum is essential to 
supporting ever -increasing wireless data use, promoting competition, and fostering our nation’s 
economic and national security.  Licensed, full -power spectrum enables  the predictable access 
needed to support investments in wide -area networks at scale.  This promotes enhanced and 
expanded coverage across the country—with 5G deployed nationwide roughly 40 percent faster 
than 4G21—while supporting mission -critical public safety and critical infrastructure uses  that 
depend on secure, reliable connectivity.   
Licensed, full -power spectrum is also bringing real competition to  the home broadband 
market place.  As the Commission recently found, without accounting for fixed wireless , 60 
percent of U.S. households have either zero or one home broadband offering available, whereas 
some 54 percent have multiple broadband options when fixed wireless access is included—
meaning fixed wireless is bringing new broadband choice to 14 percent of U.S. households .22   
Consumer s are also benefitting from this enhanced competition and innovation.  The cost 
per megabyte of data decreased by 98 percent f rom 2012 to 2022,23 and new competition from 
5G home broadband is predicted to result in $8.1 billion in savings for consumers .24  Fixed

"6 wireless access is also bridging the digital divide for the unconnected, as roughly 20 percent  of 
5G home gross adds are new to the broadband marketplace altogether .25 
The benefits of licensed, full -power spectrum to  our economy are  extensive .  The U.S. 
wireless industry supports 4.5 million  jobs and contributes $825 billion  to our economy each 
year—equivalent to the 19th largest global economy.26  Wireless l eadership, on the backbone of 
licensed, full -power networks, has profound impacts for U.S. security interests as well, as our 
spectrum decisions impact our  ability to lead global t echnology and standards development.27  
IV. THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROMOTE  OPPORTUNITIES 
FOR  LICENSED, FULL -POWER SPECTRUM . 
A. Auctioned, Full -Power Spectrum Remains the Priority.  
There is an immediate need to make additional licensed , full -power  spectrum available 
for commercial use, particularly in the mid -band range, and a temporary halt of auction authority 
should not derail our commitment to the benefits of licensing the Inventory Spectrum .  The U.S. 
trails its peers in critical licensed airwaves to support increasing demands, and that spectrum 
deficit is expected to expand as we face a nearly 1,500 -megahertz licensed spectrum shortfall in 
the next 10 years.28  Meanwhile, i n 2022, we saw a more than 38 percent increase in wireless 
traffic as compared to the year prior.29

"7 Auctions remain the most efficient mechanism for ensuring commercial wireless 
spectrum is  available to meet this demand, and the Commission  should remain focused on 
ensuring access to licensed, full -power spectrum through restoration of its auction authority.30  If 
the Commission nevertheless believes reinstatement of its auction authority is not imminent, any 
actions it takes should reflect the continued need for full -power, commercial spectrum with 
predictable rights and interference protection.   
Now is not the time to lean in on frameworks that could infringe on existing license es’ 
rights or that would be impractical to execute in the near term .  Further , there is no demonstrated, 
immediate need for additional unlicensed or shared- use spectrum, as such allocations dominate 
the mid -band landscape by four -to-one as compared to licensed allocations .31  Rather, where the 
most efficient assignment mechanism (auctions) is unavailable, and where the Commission 
wants to move forward quickly, the Commission should consider a temporary mechanism to 
introduce  licensed full-power spectrum into the market place.  
B. STAs  May Be a Reasonable Interim Solution.  
Where needed, special temporary authority (“STA”) licenses  may be a rational vehicle 
for making spectrum available from the Inventory Spectrum  pending reauthorization of the 
agency’s auction authority.32  The Commission has had success in the past using STAs.  During 
the COVID -19 pandemic, for example, the Commission freed up roughly 80 to 100 megahertz  of 
additional spectrum  that was put to use immediately  to support increasing capacity needs in the

"8 first month of the national emergency.33  STA s can be beneficial for niche and temporary use 
cases and might present a framework for enabling near -term access to otherwise fallow 
Inventory S pectrum while the Commission awaits authority to auction these frequencies.  
The Public Notice also ra ises questions  regarding a  temporary  leasing mechanism for the 
Inventory S pectrum licenses .34  The Commission should consider providing additional details  on 
this proposal, as government leasing arrangements could trigger legal challenges associated with 
agency adoption of such a  framework.35 
In any event, temporary access models should end , with a reasonable transition , once 
auction authority is restored.  Importantly, the Commission should ensure that any technical rules 
associated with such access comport with existing band- specific protections.  The Commission 
should not enact changes to the underlying service or technical rules of any impacted spectrum 
bands, as doing so would be a legally vulnerable infringement on existing licensees’ rights, 
disrupt  and fragment  the existing spectrum environment, undermine investment, and introduce 
the potential for harmful interference to existing co-  and adjacent -band licensees . 
C. Impractical or Ineffective Assignment Models Should Not Be Pursued.  
The Commission should not impose any new dynamic spectrum sharing assignments in 
existing licensed bands.36  As an initial matter, currently available complex  sharing frameworks 
have not proven effective in promoting investment or deployment, as CTIA has highlighted.37

"9 The Citizens Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”)  framework in particular has known challenges, 
as the Commerce Spectrum Management Advisory Committee recognized ,38 and available 
evidence continue s to show limited engagement in the band.39  As a result,  shared spectrum that 
is already available remains  sparsely deployed.  Moreover, applying a specialized sharing 
mechanism in isolated and disconnected channels or geographic areas that are in a band already 
licensed for full -power, flexible -rights use  and with rights to interference protection would be 
even more impractical from an economic and deployment perspective.  
Further, it took years to certify database administrators for both the CBRS and  the 6 GHz 
Automated Frequency Coordination (“AFC”) frameworks :  it took more than four years for full -
scale commercial CBRS deployment to be approved,40 and AFCs were only recently approved 
following a nearly two -and-a-half-year application and testing period, even as efforts continue to 
establish a process for handling interference complaints .41  Running the same  playbook to install 
a new sharing framework in bands that are  primarily  allocated for licensed, full -power use  would 
undoubtedly take longer than any further delay in re -gaining spectrum auction authority. 
Moreover, it would be inefficient to await standardization for new equipment for the 
Inventory Spectrum bands, and in any case,  there is little incentive from a market perspective for 
manufacturers to develop  bespoke equipment for the narrow opportunities in the inventoried

"10 bands that could be tethered to a database .  Rather, it is in the U.S. national interest to participate 
in global spectrum harmonization to assure robust and secure connectivity here and abroad.42  
Similar concerns arise with non- exclusive site -based licensing .43  Imposing such a model 
on existing licensed, flexible -use bands  would involve development of new equipment for the 
subject bands that would hinder the goal of making near -term use of the frequencies.   Importing 
new coordination obligations on existing bands  would also disrupt existing licensees’ rights and 
investments  and would require time and expense to stand up and certify the  needed  coordinators . 
V. CONCLUSION.  
While the Commission’s goal of enabling access to its I nventory Spectrum is laudable, 
none of the alternative access proposals in the Public Notice is as efficient as the proven 
licensed, full -power, flexible -rights spectrum access mechanism, made available by auction.  The 
Commission should continue to work with Congress to encourage restoration of its competitive 
bidding authority, and in the meantime pursue STAs so the spectrum does not lie fallow .

INTRODUCTION
AND
BACKGROUND
Radio
spectrum
(“spectrum”)
are
the
shared-use
access
super-highways
used
to
provide
all
wireless
services.
Demand
for
new
spectrum
allocations
continues
to
increase
exponentially,
and
spectrum
is
a
valuable
finite
resource.
Spectrum
enables
the
ability
to
send
and
receive
data
and
text
messages,
make
phone
calls,
and
get
directions
on
mobile
phones
via
satellite.
To
manage
and
allocate
non-federal
use
of
spectrum,
Congress
created
the
FCC
in
1934.

When
granting
licenses,
the
FCC
has
three
primary
objectives:
serve
the
public
interest,
prevent
interference
between
users,
and
ensure
the
most
efficient
use
of
spectrum.

In
1993,

AI-DRIVEN
SENSING
IS
CRITICAL
TO
THE
SUCCESSFUL
ALLOCATION
OF 
INVENTORY
SPECTRUM
Understanding
that
the
Commission
will
allow
the
public
to
avail
themselves
of
the
inventory
spectrum
in
one
or
more
of
the
approaches
outlined
in
the
Notice
,
efficient
allocation
must
remain
at
the
forefront
of
all
discussions.
To
this
end,
we
preface
our
responses
to
the
questions
posed
in
the
Notice
with
the
rationale
for
wide-spread
use
of
AI-driven
spectrum
sensing:
it
is
more
efficient,
cost
effective,
and
environmentally-friendly
than
traditional
methods.
Efficiency
is
essential
to
successful
wireless
sensing,
and
through
automation,
AI
can
sense
and
optimize
spectrum
utilization
–
faster,
more
accurately,
and
at
lower
cost
than
has
been
possibly
using
traditional
approaches
–
by
including
a
spectrum
sensing
capability
natively
as
a
software
function
within
new
and
existing
wireless
systems,
near
real-time
information
on
RF
emissions,
interference,
and
propagation
information
can
be
provided
to
humans
and
automated
spectrum
allocation
systems
with
minimal
incremental
cost
to
deploy
and
operate.
By
identifying
potential
congestion,
interference,
or
spectrum
underutilization,
these
systems
can
provide
rapid
feedback
into
how
spectrum
is
allocated
to
provide
optimal
use.
Without
human-in-the-loop
dependence,
AI
can
make
adjustments
to
ensure
optimization
at
all
times,
and
can
operate
at
machine
speed.
Furthermore,
the
predictive
capabilities
of
AI
allow
for
better
anticipation
of
network
demands,
ensuring
that
spectrum
resources
are
always
primed
to
handle
both
current
and
upcoming
data
transmission
needs.
Economically
,
as
outlined
above,
automated
systems
such
as
efficient
AI
based
sensors
deployed
broadly,
drastically
reduce
the
need
for
continuous
manual
monitoring
or
dedicated
measurement
equipment,
translating
to
lower
operational
costs
and
greatly

DISCUSSION
OF
POSED
QUESTIONS
AND
METHODS
Historically,
the
Commission
has
not
employed
a
one-size-fits-all
approach
to
the
methods
by
which
spectrum
is
managed.
The
Commission
has
three
primary
methodologies:
licensed,
unlicensed,
and
shared
spectrum
allocation
–
all
of
which
serve
different
objectives
and
accommodate
the
diverse
ecosystems
of
wireless
communications
services
and
systems.
We
respond
to
questions
1
through
6
posed
in
section
B.
DeepSig
does
not
have
comments
on
the
question
numbered
“7”.
A.
Question
1
As
a
whole,
lowering
the
barrier
to
spectrum
access
can
prove
to
be
a
powerful
enabler
in
fostering
new
and
innovative
uses
of
spectrum
to
drive
economic
growth.
Allowing
unlicensed
access
or
short-term,
non-exclusive
spectrum
leasing
is
one
way
this
can
be
accomplished.
On
the
prevention
of
interference
and
promotion
of
co-existence,
we
believe
it
is
band-
and
use-dependent.
Looking
at
the
lower
bands
(i.e.
below
1
GHz),
which
have
excellent
propagation
properties,
are
harder
to
share
in
an
uncontrolled
manner;
spectrum
orchestration
services
or
a
dynamic
frequency
coordinator
would
help
to
orchestrate
and
coordinate
usage
in
these
bands.
Whereas
in
higher
bands,
such
as
MVDDS
at
12
GHz
or
higher,
radios
typically
use
high
directivity
to
achieve
the
desired
link
margin.
This
inherently
helps
in
coexistence
of
multiple
systems
making
it
easier
to
achieve
mutual
spatial
isolation
(e.g.
using
beam
or
spatial
processing",2,DeepSig Comments on Facilitating Access to Inventory Spectrum.pdf,DeepSig,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"techniques).
In
some
of
these
cases,
less
coordination
may
be
needed
leading
to
the
potential
for
more
broad
unlicensed
re-use.
B.
Question
2
Rules
that
require
radio
devices
used
in
specified
bands
to
perform
spectrum
coordination
through
spectrum
sensing,
interference
identification,
and
reporting
of
interference
are
critical
to
ensuring
spectrum
can
be
shared
efficiently
and
intelligently.
Automated
techniques,
such
as
AI-driven
spectrum
coordination,
resource
allocation,
and
deconfliction
of
adjacent
use,
can
be
implemented
to
prevent
interference.
We
are
cognizant
that
agencies
across
the
United
States
Department
of
Defense
(“DOD”)
have
mission-critical
spectrum
and
want
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
interference
-
direct
coordination
between
DOD
and
the
spectrum
coordination
service
can
often
help
to
safeguard
these
applications
while
minimizing
their
required
spectrum.
This
is
of
great
interest
to
DeepSig,
because
we
invest
heavily
in
AI-driven
technology
to
sense
spectrum,
consolidate
the
data
into
compact,
descriptive
metadata
information
about
emissions
and
interference
patterns.
This
metadata
can
be
shared
between
networks
and,
in
the
case
of
dynamic
spectrum
sharing,
the
users
and
spectrum
coordinators
without
significant
overhead
communication
costs
and
while
preserving
privacy.
To
prevent
co-channel
and
adjacent
band
interference
issues,
dynamic
frequency
coordination
services
could
be
further
t
improved.
We
make
three
recommendations
for
improvement:
(1)
near-real-time
information
from
network
elements
on
interference
and
power
levels
in
addition
to
received
signal
events
and
channel
information,
(2)
high-quality
data-driven
propagation
models
to
improve
propagation
accuracy
to
enable
improved
allocations
with
little
chance
for
interference
and
spectrum
leases
that
allow
for
maximal
allocation
and
re-use
of
spectrum
under
the
acceptable
interference
threshold,
and
(3)
near-real-time
coordination
protocols
between
networks
and
coordination
services
to
allow
for
adjustment
or
adaptation
to
unexpected
interference,
service
degradation,
or
changes
in
emitters,
e.g.
by
employing
AI
methods
for
joint
resource
optimization
at
one
or
more
of
these
elements.
These
three
factors
are
key
to
accelerating
next-generation
dynamic
frequency
determination
by
using
AI
and
ML.
The
Commission
can
incentivize
policies
to
accelerate
adoption
and
deployment
of
these
technologies
to
make
spectrum
more
efficient

"the

and

C.
Question
3
Making
spectrum
more
readily
available
will
result
in
a
wider
array
of
services
utilizing
it.
This
is
evident
with
the
proliferation
of
WiFi,
and
we
may
anticipate
a
similar
broad
adoption
of
private
5G
(i.e.
NR-U),
and
eventually,
private
6G
services.
These
services
could
flourish
if
we
succeed
in
lowering
the
barriers
to
entry,
streamlining
spectrum
coordination,
and
making
the
deployment
of
such
systems
more
cost-effective,
faster,
and
simpler.
Additionally,
incentivizing
the
adoption
of
core
enabling
technologies
from
Q2
can
facilitate
progress,
particularly
as
these
technologies
are
integrated
into
high-volume
production
solutions.
(e.g.
helping
to
fund
early
deployments
or
technology
adoption,
pricing
spectrum
access
to
encourage
their
use,
requiring
certain
capabilities,
etc).
D.
Question
4
In
General,
lower
bands
with
higher
transmission
ranges
will
require
more
careful
coordination
and
deconfliction
(e.g.
through
a
dynamic
spectrum
coordination
service)
to
better
achieve
efficient
resource
allocation
and
avoid
interference.
On
the
other
hand,
higher
bands
could
be
less
controlled,
due
to
their
short-range
propagation
and
ease
of
containment
(e.g.
nearby,
indoor,
highly
directive,
etc)
such
as
potentially
being
fully
unlicensed
in
some
cases.
Ideally,
a
set
of
common
rules
would
be
established
across
various
bands,
with
potentially
different
permissibility
levels
to
enable
the
use
of
a
universal
dynamic
frequency
coordinator
across
them
in
a
relatively
uniform
manner.
This
could
entail
the
need
for
varying
capabilities
within
each
band,
tailored
to
the
specific
services
they
will
support,
the
permitted
power
levels,
the
potential
for
interference,
the
propagation
properties
of
the
band,
and
the
possibility
of

COMMENTS OF 
OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AT NEW AMERICA  
AND PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE  
 
The Open Technology Institute at New America and Public  Knowledge file these 
comments in response to the Public Notice , captioned above, released by the Wireless 
Telecommun ications Bureau on March 7, 2024.   
Our groups agree the Commission should put its inventory of unassigned spectrum  to 
work, particular ly the substantial blocks of mid -band spectrum useful for wireless broadband. 
We su ggest that in light of the need to resolve potentially co nflicting  demand s for access without 
resort to an auction, a framework premis ed on coordinated sharing, licensing  by rule , relatively 
lower power limits and automated database coordination can be implemented quickly and will 
best serve the public interest . 
Background  
The Bureau  “seeks comment on how the Commission, if necessary,  could use its current 
statutory authority to provide the public with access to its inventory of currently  unassigned 
spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions (hereafter,",0,OTI_PK_Comments_PNAuctionInventory_FINAL_040824.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AT NEW AMERICA,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 Inventory Spectrum ).”1 This is, in all likelihood, a temporary challenge since legislation to renew 
and extend  the Commission ’s auction authority  is pending in Congress. However, we believe the 
Bureau is wise to seek this input for two reasons: First, because the current stalemate in Congress 
seems likely to extend beyond this year and well into the next Congress. Second, because this 
inquiry is a forward -looking opportunity to get input on a variety of other options for authorizing 
access to unused spectrum  that are more and more relevant as fewer and fewer valu able bands 
will be available for the sort of traditional auctions of very wide -area and high -power exclusive 
licenses that the Public Notice  describes.  
Indeed, while auctions have proven to be a successful industrial policy  that has facilitated 
mobile phone and mobile broadband data networks  that cover  most populated areas across the 
nation, with a few low -dollar exceptions  all of the FCC ’s auctions have been designed 
specifically to parcel out  spectrum configured for  a small handful of big companies for basically 
one single service. In contrast, t he vast majority of frequency bands and spectrum assignments 
across the spectrum – and the overw helming majority of the wireless data and communication 
carrie d over the public airwaves (certainly more than 90 percent) – occurs on spectrum that is 
either shared or, in a few cases (e.g., broadcasting  channels),  assigned be fore the advent of 
auctions. In fact, unlicensed spectrum bands at 2.4 GHz and in portions of 5 GHz by themselves 
have been carrying more than four times as much data traffic to and from  mobile  devices  as all 
the spectrum bands ever  auctioned by the FCC.2 The share of data traffic offloaded via Wi -Fi is

 likely to increase further as new high -bandwidth applications, such as augmented and virtual 
reality (AR/VR) are used most frequently at home, work and other indoor locatio ns.3 
The distinction between spectrum for coverage (which fits the traditional cellular 
licensing model) and spectrum for capacity in localized areas (which is the rationale for 
unlicensed  and lightly -licensed, shared spectrum) is even more relevant for 5G in light of the fact 
that an increasing share of mobile device data traffic (more than 80 percent) is consumed 
indoors, on a nomadic and not mobile basis.  America’s “5G” and future “6G” w ireless 
ecosystems, like the current 4G wireless ecosystem, will rely on a combination of big national or 
regional carrier networks for truly “mobile” coverage ( connections  for use ‘on the go’) and a far 
larger number of complementary, high -capacity and customized networks deployed by 
individual enterprises, households and community anchor institutions to supply high capacity  
indoors and to meet their particular needs at a lower cost.  
It is true that the low - and mid -band spectrum most valu able for wide -area mobile 
services has become more and more difficult to clear and repurpose for exclusive licensing. 
However, contrary to assumptions of scarcity, innovative and forward -looking spectrum policies 
can unlock an abundance of wireless bandwid th in a larger number of underutilized bands —and 
for an increasingly diverse range of users and use cases —through dynamic spectrum sharing.

 Open the Broadband Inventory for General Authorized Access  
The Public Noti ce seeks comment on the option of using “dynamic spectrum sharing. ”4 
The distinctions mentioned just above are relevant in this context because our groups believe 
they highlight an opportunity  for the Commission to make most of its Inventory Spectrum 
available quickly on a shared , coordinated , local and lower -power  basis  for flexible use . The 
unassigned spectrum  bands  the Bureau lists as “supporting broadband services ” (e.g., 600 MHz, 
700 MHz, 800 MHz , Cellular, AWS -3, PCS, BRS ) are licensed for flexible use and could be 
made available quickly for General Aut horized Access  (GAA) use at least  until such time as the 
Commission has the authority and makes a future  decision to auction it.  One or more of th e 
existing frequency coordination systems already certified  to manage spectrum sharing in the 
CBRS and/or 6 GHz bands  can be authorized to both register and optimize shared access. Even if 
users cannot rely long term on opportunistic access to  this spectrum to support a commercial 
service, it can augmen t capacity  short term . And even making it av ailable for a de fined period of 
time could provide  practical input to help  guide a future decision  about whether a PAL -type 
auction (viz., lower -power, smaller licensing areas) , or continued use for GAA, best serves the 
public inte rest in any or all of these bands.  
The mos t notable exception to th e pattern of the FCC designing auc tions to meet the 
business model of a small number of companies for a very wide area mobile service  has been the 
relatively re cent auction of lower -power, county -sized priority access licenses in the  Citizen 
Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band at 3.5 GHz.  CBRS is itself a hybrid band and licensed by 
rule. CBRS ha s been among the FCC’s most successful spectrum policy innovations, one being 
replicated by regulators in the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and more than a dozen other

 nations (albeit with manual coordination to date).5  Incumbent military operations have  been 
fully protected and, in less than four years of commercial operations, the scale of deployment 
and innovation in the band has far exceeded expectations.  The OnGo Alliance, an association of 
more than 200 companies making commercial use of CBRS, repo rted in September that 
deployments already include more than 36,000 base stations (CBSDs) deployed by more than  
1,000 entities (e.g., WISPs, enterprises, mobile carriers, schools) , most of which are leveraging  
the opportunistic GAA tier .6  
By using the GAA tier of CBRS as a model, the Commission can not only move quickly, 
but also preserve the option to auction Priority Access Licenses (PA Ls) for some or all of th is 
Inventory Spectrum at a later date when the agency ’s authority is fully restored. An advantage 
here is optionality: With General Authority Access conditional, the Commission can later assess 
– based on actual deployments and other factors – whether and where to have auctions, as well as 
whether  and where to continue allowing , as it do es in the CBRS band, the GAA users to continue 
operating in PAL spectrum on a non -interfering basis.  
The availability of certified SAS and AFC coordination mech anisms should als o be an 
important consideration for  this initiative. Dynamic spectrum coordi nation systems have  
capabilities that can optimize the number of  users sharing the band in a given location and more 
efficiently enforce any needed protection for adjacent band incumbents. The current SAS s are 
well-established and proven; and i t is likely that one or more of the certified 6 GHz AFC systems

 also could be adapted quickly to manage acces s and minimize in terference in these bands, 
avoiding years of delay.  
 
Coordina ted Site -Based Licensing Could Provide  Both Access and Certainty in Some  Bands  
 
The Public Notice also seeks comment on the use of “non-exclusive site -based 
licensing. ”7 While the coordinated but open access GAA approach we propose above would 
presumably, like CBRS, be charac terized by flexible use and lower power, in some Inventory 
Spectrum  the Commission could consider resolving potentially competing demand through 
coordination and first -in-time rights, as it has done in most fixed link bands  for decades. Part 101 
coordination among tens of tho usands of fixed links and fixed satellite earth stations pre-dates 
auctions  and can be streamlined using  certified geolocation database coordination.8 The database 
coordination  mechanism that has long coordinated shared use of  the 70/80/90 GHz  bands for 
fixed point -to-point links is a good model.   The Commission could adopt a nationwide, non-
exclusive shared licensing framework  that takes advantage of the proven capabilities of 
automated frequency coordination systems to optimize coexistence among as many users and use 
cases as feasible in a location or local area.  
Conversely , traditional manual Part 101 coordination should be avoided, since it is slow, 
expensive  and unnecessary . Similar  to the process for the 70/80/90 GHz band, operators should 
first apply to the Commission for a nationwide, non -exclusive license.   This would ensure that all 
users can be identified by the Commission and allow the AFCs to veri fy their eligibility to 
request and receive frequency assignments.  Once approved and registered with the Commission,

8 For example, the Commission has been allotting microwave spectrum  for coordinated and 
shared fixed use for most of its history. See “Allocation of Frequencies in the Bands Above 890 
Mc.,” Report and Order, Docket No. 11866, 27 FCC 359 (1959).",5,OTI_PK_Comments_PNAuctionInventory_FINAL_040824.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AT NEW AMERICA,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 licensees would be eligible to register fixed link paths , or individual access points  (preferably by 
sector),  directly through the AFC.9 As WISPA explain ed in its 42 G Hz comments last August, a  
“strict site -based licensing structure is particularly unsuitable for PtMP  [point -to-multi -point].”10 
We also suggest coordination of point -to-multi -point use by sector,  allowing the use of an AFC -
type mechanism  has the capability to coordinate in more users. More generally, manual site-
based licensing is burdensome on all parties (including Commission staff), slow and very costly 
in comparison to near -real-time, fine -grained , consistent  and low -cost coordination by a dynamic 
spectrum management system.11 
If the Commission seeks to offer the c ertainty of first -in-time rights in some bands, an 
automated frequency coordination mechanism can serve this purpose particularly well (in 
addition to potentially managi ng GAA use of other Spectr um Inventory bands). The registration 
of a local link path or sector – whether for point -to-multipoint  (PtMP)  or for small cell mobile 
coverage – should serve as a “reservation” for certain channels for a relatively short period of 
time (such as two or three months). The registration (re servation)  should put a hold on  a specific 
set of fr equencies that will be immediately placed in operation  at that location ( e.g., 20 
megahertz) and should expire if the licensee does not commence service within that time frame. 
While providing certainty that the operator has an assignment, expiration after a relatively short

 period will also deter warehousing and encourage operators not to register links or APs until they 
are ready, or nearly ready, to deploy.  
The AFC should be authorized to accept or reject subsequent re servations in that genera l 
location based on a n alg orithm that avoids conflicting assignment s. Ideally the AFC should be 
authorized or required to provide alternative configurations that would successfully co ordinate 
(e.g., more  separat ion, less power,  different  channel ). the AFC should process requests for 
frequencies and power levels and determine the assignment (or options for assignments) that best 
optimize coexistence with other operators that have already commenced service or registered for 
an assignment in that area.  
 
Leasing the Spectrum Inventory Could be Problematic  
 
Finally, the Bureau asks for comment on the option of leasing spectru m inventory 
licenses. This may be particularly useful  for exclusive geographic area  licenses  that offer  
relatively  narrow  channels and low-band p ropagation capability (e.g., 600  MHz , 700  MHz , 800 
MHz) , inasmuch as they may offer a n incu mbent carrier an opportunity  to expand its capacity 
(albeit on a temporary or contingent basis).  A major obstac le would be designing a lease offer 
(e.g., a reserve price) that is likely to avoid conflicting applications. Presumably it would not 
work to raise the price i f more than o ne operator accepted the price offered , since that would be 
tantamount  to conducting an auction.  We believe this exacerbates the more general problem  that 
leasing Inventory Spectrum – particularly  over relatively large geographic licensing areas – will 
exclude all but the larg est incumbent operators , especially  in rural and less populated areas . This 
would create barriers to entry for small and rural operators  compared to the GAA model we 
recommend above . Leasing exclusive l icenses over large geographic areas could also result in  
spectrum warehousing  in the absence of build -out requirements .",7,OTI_PK_Comments_PNAuctionInventory_FINAL_040824.pdf,OPEN TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE AT NEW AMERICA,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 Assign  Spectrum To Tribes  
To the extent unassigned spectrum covers Tribal lands, the Commission should adopt a 
Tribal Priority Window to assign the spectrum to Tribal governments. The Commission has 
adequate authority to create licenses covering tribal lands and to assign them thro ugh its 
traditional Section 307 and 309 authority.12 Creating a TPW would further the Commission’s 
goals of equity and inclusion by enhancing Tribal connectivity. A TPW would a lso further the 
goals of the MoU between the Commission, the NTIA and the  Department of Interior.13 
Conclusion  
The Commission should put its inventory of unassigned spectrum  to work, particular ly the 
substantial blocks of mid -band spectrum useful for wireless broadband. We su ggest that in light 
of the need to resolve potentially competing demand s for access without resort to an auction, a 
framework premis ed on coordinated sharing, licensing  by rule,  lower power . and automated 
database coordination can be implemented quickly and will best serve the public interest .

COMMENTS  OF THE BLOOSTON RURAL CARRIERS  
The Law Firm of Blooston, Mordkofsky, Dickens & Prendergast, LLP, on behalf of its 
rural and independent telephone carrier and wireless service provider clients (the “Blooston 
Rural Carriers”), submits these comments on ways to facilitate access to current ly unassigned 
auction inventory spectrum (“Inventory Spectrum”) for wireless radio services, in light of the 
ongoing lapse of FCC auction authority.1  The Blooston Rural Carriers applaud the Commission 
for inviting comment on ways it might facilitate the deployment of spectrum that has lied fallow 
for years, so that advanced wireless services can be implemented more quickly .  Providing 
alternative ways for incumbent licensees and new operators to secure access to an underutilized 
resource would be especially important for rural Americans, since many of the licenses that went 
unsold in prior auctions encompassed sparsely popu lated areas.  
The FCC has identified three broad approaches that it could use to make Inventory 
Spectrum available for public use in the absence of auction authority.  These options include: (1) 
providing access through dynamic spectrum sharing techniques; (2) providing  access through 
non-exclusive site -based licensing; and (3) leasing spectrum inventory licenses, as well as

 combinations of approaches and other methods that could be used to make Inventory Spectrum 
available to the public. The Blooston Rural Carriers provide comment on these options below, 
and urge the Commission to be clear about what will happen to shared and /or non -exclusive 
operations if and when the FCC’s auction authority is restored, and the Inventory Spectrum may 
be made available for bidding.  To promote meaningful investment in rural services, the 
Commission needs to provide a way for entrepreneurs and  small business operators in rural 
markets earn exclusive rights on Inventory Spectrum channels in rural areas where they have 
spent the time, money and effort to construct facilities and provide service to customers.  Any 
subsequent reauction of exclusive  use geographic licenses for the Inventory Spectrum band 
should feature “overlay” licenses that require the auction winner to protect new site -based 
operations that are deployed under the Commission’s proposed non -auction mechanism; and the 
Commission shou ld also provide a substantial “rural incumbent” bidding credit for small 
businesses that seek to bid on any co -channel geographic licenses that overlap their site -based 
operations.  
I. Non-Exclusive Site -Based Licensing Would Appear to Be the Quickest and Least 
Expensive Way to Make Spectrum Available for Rural Service.  
As noted in the Inventory Spectrum Access PN , the Commission has decades of 
experience with site -based licensing, and this could be implemented consistent with existing 
spectrum allocations and service rules.  The Blooston Rural Carriers believe this would provide a 
simpler and lower cost way to pro mote access to spectrum in rural areas, and by entrepreneurs 
and smaller operators.    Third -party spectrum coordinators (as used in licensing Part 90 channels) 
as well as licensee -to-licensee coordination of technical parameters could be relied upon to 
minimize harmful interference between operators. While the PN proposes “non -exclusive” site -
based licenses, it is respectfully submitted that rural licensees should be able to establish",1,Blooston Comments on Facilitating Access to Inventory Spectrum - FINAL.pdf,THE BLOOSTON RURAL CARRIERS,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 exclusivity, similar to the FB8 exclusivity that is available for Part 90 Private Land Mobile 
licensees. Otherwise, investment in a wireless system operating in what is often difficult terrain 
and lower population density will be discouraged, and the Inven tory Spectrum will remain 
unused.  All Inventory Spectrum is embodied in licenses that were available for purchase in a 
prior auction, so allowing exclusivity to site -based licensees willing to step into the void would 
not be unfair to any eventual auction  participant.  
The primary benefit of site -based licensing is that it could be implemented quickly, 
allowing smaller service providers in rural areas to gain access to higher power licensed 
spectrum bands.  Access to licensed high -power spectrum is particularly important  for carriers 
that wish to use wireless facilities to support Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment 
(BEAD) Program buildouts to unserved and underserved area s.   
Creating a mechanism for small and rural carriers to obtain protection rights and bidding 
credits that could be used if and when larger geographic area licenses are made available at 
auction, would incentivize network buildout in rural areas and greater op portunities for small 
businesses, in furtherance of the Commission’s public interest goals.  The Commission recently 
confirmed the importance of these goals when creating the Enhanced Competition Incentive 
Program  (“ECIP”) .2  It would allow rural carriers to expand existing networks, and to build new 
networks incrementally.  Areas built out in this manner within a reasonable amount of time ( e.g., 
5 years) should be granted fully licensed status, with incumbent protection rights and a renewal 
expectancy. And any licenses subsequently made available for bidding for the same 
bands/channels should be treated as geographic overlay licenses, granting r ights to any unused

 spectrum in the service area subject to protecting the incumbent operators. The success of FCC 
Auction No. 108 and the Commission’s licensing of county -based geographic overlay licenses 
for spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band demonstrate not only that this type o f auction is feasible, but it 
is accepted by the wireless marketplace and compatible with incumbent site -based licensing.  
II. Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Shows Promise, But is Too Complex and Costly for 
Operations in Spectrum Bands Not Designed at the Outset for Dynamic Sharing.  
Dynamic spectrum sharing is familiar to rural service provides and is essentially the 
CBRS model.  If the Commission were to grant access to Inventory Spectrum via dynamic 
sharing, it would need to set up one or more dynamic frequency coordinators (similar  to an SAS 
Administrator for CBRS) and allow them to manage access to the spectrum by multiple users 
pursuant to band sharing rules.  However, the process of identifying and approving dynamic 
frequency coordinators would take significant time.  Also, it is  unclear how much time and 
resources would be needed to develop sensing and end user equipment needed to implement 
dynamic sharing, and who would be responsible for these additional costs.  If and when the 
Commission’s auction authority is restored, what w ould happen to the dynamic frequency 
coordinator’s business prospects (unless the Commission is prepared to forego any future auction 
of Inventory Spectrum)?  
Dynamic sharing could be a feasible model for making spectrum available for operators 
to increase capacity their existing networks, but it probably would not offer enough certainty to 
encourage long -term investment needed for new operators, or for service in rural or underserved 
areas.  Many details would need to be worked out before the Blooston Rural Carriers could 
support use of a dynamic sharing model to facilitate access to Inventory spectrum, but it is clear 
that adding a significant layer of cost and  complexity to the process will be a disincentive for",3,Blooston Comments on Facilitating Access to Inventory Spectrum - FINAL.pdf,THE BLOOSTON RURAL CARRIERS,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"5 
 
 small and rural carriers.  Also, developing protocols for dynamic sharing in licensed, exclusive 
use spectrum bands is likely to be both time consuming and highly controversial for a 
commercial spectrum marketplace that is built around exclusive use licens es; and this process 
could slow down deployment of Inventory Spectrum.  
III. Making Inventory Spectrum Licenses Available by Lease Would Be of Limited 
Use for Small Carriers.  
The Blooston Rural Carriers believe that use of a spectrum leasing model for Inventory 
Licenses would be strongly disfavored by small and rural service providers.  Without the 
certainty of an exclusive use license, rural operators would be reluctant to mak e the significant 
investments needed to expand their networks and services into new and unserved/underserved 
areas.  What would happen to lessees if/when the FCC’s spectrum auction authority is restored?  
Would existing leases be treated as an encumbrance on licenses that are made available for 
auction?  What if that spectrum was being used to meet a BEAD grantee’s performance 
obligations?  Also, how would the FCC establish an appropriate price for a spectrum lease?  And 
if an overlay license is eventually awarded, could this licensee drive off any lessees by unduly 
raising rent?  
The Blooston Rural Carriers fear that a spectrum leasing model would unduly favor large 
companies with deep pockets and incumbent licensees that are able to easily add capacity to 
existing networks, possibly with just a flip of a switch.  This isn’t to say  that the Commission 
shouldn’t pursue a leasing option for inventory spectrum in all cases, because it may be very well 
suited for both small and large carriers that want to add additional network capacity for a limited 
time, to address marketplace needs.",4,Blooston Comments on Facilitating Access to Inventory Spectrum - FINAL.pdf,THE BLOOSTON RURAL CARRIERS,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"6 CONCLUSION  
The Blooston Rural Carriers urge the Commission to use this proceeding as a n 
opportunity to develop alternative ways t o put spectrum resources to use by operators that are 
willing to invest in constructing networks and providing services in rural and unserved or 
underserved  areas.  Site -based licensing, in particular, is a mechanism that the Commission has 
experience with and that could be used to put Inventory Spectrum into the hands of operators 
quickly, and without the added cost or complexity of dynamic  spectrum sharing , and with greater 
long-term certainty than spectrum leasing .  The Commission could make site -based licensing a 
more attractive option for small and rural carriers by also c reating a mechanism for operators to 
obtain protection rights as well as  bidding credits that could be used if and when larger 
geographic area licenses are made available at auction . Incentivizing network buildout in rural 
areas and providing opportunities for small businesses in  this manner would serve  the 
Commission’s public interest goals.

COMMENTS OF AT&T SERVICES, INC. 
AT&T Services, Inc. (“AT&T”) hereby submits these comments in response to the Public 
Notice issued by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (“WTB” or “Bur eau”) of the Federal 
Communications Commission’s (“FCC” or “Commission”) seeking comment on “how the Commission should fulfill its responsibility to ma ke spectrum resources available for use in the 
public interest, in light of the Commissi on’s lack of statutor y auction authority.”
1  AT&T shares 
the Commission’s disappointment with the ongoing lapse in the Commission’s auction authority.  
For nearly thirty years, the Commission’s au ction program was a major policy triumph and 
statutory auction authority wa s uninterrupted.  AT&T urges Congress to restore the FCC’s 
auction authority as soon as possible, but in the interim the Commission can and should find 
ways to make its unassigned spectrum inventory2 (“Inventory Spectrum”) available to support

supporting broadband services ( e.g., 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, Cellular, AWS-3, PCS,

 wireless services.  As explained herein, AT&T  favors a Special Temporary Authority framework 
that would enable this spectrum to  be rapidly put to beneficial us e, while preserving the ability to 
auction these licenses in the future.  Of the various appro aches proposed by th e Commission, this 
is both the most logistically feasible path  and the one most in the public interest. 
I. AUCTIONS REMAIN THE BEST W AY TO ALLOCATE EXCLUSIVELY 
LICENSED SPECTRUM, AND CONGRE SS SHOULD ACT PROMPTLY TO 
RESTORE THE COMMISSION’S  AUCTION AUTHORITY 
In the thirty years since Congress first granted auction authority to the Commission, 
spectrum auctions have proven to be a policy triumph.  The Commission’s auction framework 
has made the United States a leader in 3G, 4G, and now 5G wireless  services, unleashing 
innovation and promoting competitio n while raising billions for the U.S. Treasury.  Time and 
time again, auctions have been proven to be th e most efficient and pr oductive means of making 
spectrum available for wireless services.  Put simply, “FCC spectrum auctions have fueled 
American growth for three decades …It’s not just that these auctions are a good deal; they are a 
big reason why the United States leads the worl d in wireless innovation.  They are also an 
essential part of our econ omic and national security.”3 
Last year’s lapse in the Commission’s auction authority is unprecedented and regrettable.  
As Chairwoman Rosenworcel has noted, “[the FCC’s] auction program has enjoyed broad 
bipartisan support here at home…in the past Congress always extended FCC auction authority 
 
require a different approach based on the diffe ring technical characteri stics between broadband 
and narrowband spectrum. 
3  Federal Communications Commission, “On 30th Anniversary of FCC Spectrum Auctions, 
FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel Calls for Congres sional Renewal of Expired Authority,” (Aug. 
10, 2023).",1,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 without interruption.”4  AT&T agrees with Chairwom an Rosenworcel and shares her 
disappointment that for more than a year, Congre ss has failed to act to restore the Commission’s 
auction authority.  AT&T urges Congress to do so expeditiously.5  Given the Commission’s lack 
of authority, AT&T appreciates the Commission’s  effort to explore means for the Inventory 
Spectrum to be put to use in the public interest in the interim.  Auctions are not only the ideal 
model for assigning exclusiv e-use, licensed mobile spectrum in general, they also are the correct 
model for licensing the Inventor y Spectrum.  For this reason, AT&T urges the Commission to 
adopt a temporary spectrum use framework that  will preserve the Commission’s ability to 
conduct an auction for thes e licenses in the future. 
II. THE COMMISSION CAN PROMOTE THE PU BLIC INTEREST BY ENABLING 
USE OF INVENTORY SPECTRUM ON A TEMPORARY BASIS 
AT&T supports the use of Special Temporary Authority (“STA”) to enable use of the 
Inventory Spectrum until such time as the Com mission is able to reauction these licenses.  
Special Temporary Authority is a win-win: not only will the Commission retain the ability to 
auction this spectrum down the road, but a temp orary use framework will provide interim access 
to entities that are able and motivated to ra pidly put the spectrum to use for the benefit of 
wireless users.  AT&T proposes a framework that combines elements of two successful 
Commission initiatives: (1) the STAs granted to  wireless carriers to use Inventory Spectrum 
 
4   Remarks of FCC Chairwoman Jessica Ro senworcel on National Spectrum Strategy (Nov. 
13, 2023), available at https://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenw orcel-remarks-national-spectrum-
strategy. 
5  AT&T also recognizes the importance of ma intaining a robust sp ectrum pipeline and 
encourages stakeholders to identify additional spectrum bands that can be made available to 
support mobile broadband services.  There is a particular need fo r additional mid-band spectrum 
if the United States is to keep up with its peer nations in 5G.",2,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"4 
 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) the relicensing process for 700 MHz spectrum 
surrendered under “keep-w hat-you-serve” rules. 
As the Public Notice explains, the STA frame work has many benefits .  Specifically, it is 
a “well-established access mechanism” that “pro vides for non-interfering use of spectrum.”6  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission issued several STAs, including for some of 
the Inventory Spectrum , that allowed for the rapid expansi on of wireless network capacity on a 
non-interfering basis.7  By using STAs, the Commission can ensure that this spectrum is 
promptly put to use.  There will be no need for the Commission to develop new application forms, filing processes, or technical rules.  And further, the STA mechanism will enable a 
seamless transition from temporary to perman ent licenses when the time comes.   
Special Temporary Authority is , by definition, temporary.  Howe ver, AT&T notes that it 
is impossible to predict when the Commission ma y be able to legally auction the Inventory 
Spectrum.  AT&T supports the us e of STAs to make productiv e use of this spectrum, but 
because access to spectrum is key to wireless  competition, and because these STAs may last 
significantly longer than the typical 180 days, specific guard rails are appropriate. 
First, the Commission should establish a formal, orderly process for issuing STAs for the 
Inventory Spectrum, modeled after its 700 MHz “keep-what-you-serve” relicensing model.
8  
Specifically, the Commission should issue a Publ ic Notice announcing available licenses and

7  See, e.g., Federal Communications Commission, “F CC Provides T-Mobile Temporary 
Access to Additional Spectrum to Help keep  Americans Connected During Coronavirus 
Pandemic,” (Mar. 15, 2020).

Spectrum in Unserved Areas , Public Notice, DA 19-77 (Feb. 12, 2019) (“ KWYS Public Notice ”).",3,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

 establish a limited filing window  during which applicants may submit applications for STA.9  If 
mutually exclusive applications are filed, th e Commission should provide a limited settlement 
period for the applicants to resolve the mutual exclusivity.10  If mutual exclusivity cannot be 
resolved, then the Inventory Sp ectrum in question should not be made available for relicensing 
until such time as it can be reauctioned.11 
Second, to ensure that STAs go to entities prepared  to rapidly put this spectrum to use for 
the benefit of consumers, the FCC should impose aggressive pe rformance requirements.12  
AT&T proposes that as a conditi on of renewal beyond the initial 180 day term, any STA user of 
Inventory Spectrum must demonstrat e with each subsequent renewa l that it has met applicable 
performance requirements for licenses in this service.13  This would certainly “better incentivize 
network investment and robust use of the Inventory Spectrum in the public interest.”14 
 
9  Id. ¶ 51. 
10  Id. ¶ 52. 
11  In the “keep-what-you-serve” process, any unresolved mutu al exclusivity would have 
subjected the mutually exclusiv e applications to auction, but as the Commission lacks auction 
authority, a logical alternative is for the Commissi on to continue holding the spectrum in reserve.  
KWYS Public Notice, ¶ 55. 
12  For licenses that are held in inventory because the original licensee failed to meet 
performance requirements, the Commission should im pose eligibility restrictions that would bar 
the prior licensee from applying for an STA, similar to that used in the 700 MHz relicensing process.  Id., ¶ 64. 
13  This would be the initial performance re quirement for AWS-3 and 600 MHz licenses, and 
the final performance require ment for other licenses.  See 47 C.F.R. § 27.14. 
14  Public Notice , ¶ 13.",4,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"6 
 Third, to facilitate the transition to use of this spectrum by future auction winners,15 the 
Commission should establish that these STAs will extinguish after the announcement of winning 
bidders in whichever auction results in the succ essful re-licensing of th e applicable Inventory 
Spectrum.  If the STA holder is not the winning bidder and needs a dditional time to transition off 
of these frequencies, the Commission could c onsider an additional 180-day STA that would 
allow the STA holder to continue operating on a secondary, non-interferin g basis and would not 
be renewed absent extraordinary circumstances.16  If the STA holder is the winning bidder, or if 
the STA holder and winning bidder are commonly controlled, the Commi ssion should permit the 
STA holder to continue operating on its ST A until its permanent license is issued. 
AT&T believes that this framewor k, if adopted, could also be us ed in the future.  Most, if 
not all, of the Inventory Spect rum had been inventory for seve ral years when the Commission’s 
auction authority lapsed.  AT&T sees no reason why this framework could not be used in the 
future to enable productive use of spectrum he ld in inventory, even after the Commission’s 
auction authority resume s and the current batch of Inventor y Spectrum is, hopefully, reauctioned 
and relicensed.  To ensure that such STAs ar e not seen as an end -run around robust auction 
participation, the Commission could consider a ma ndatory holding period for licenses that fail to 
sell at auction during which no pa rty could file for an STA, ab sent emergency circumstances.

 III. THE OTHER AUCTION ALTERNATIVES WOULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE 
INVENTORY SPECTRUM’S HIGHEST AND BEST USE 
In the Public Notice, the Bureau also  seeks comment on whether dynamic spectrum 
sharing approaches or non-exclusive site-based licensing could be used to facilitate access to 
Inventory Spectrum.  AT&T opposes these proposal s, as they would be complicated and time-
consuming to put in place and would not enable  the highest and best use of the Inventory 
Spectrum in the short or long term. 
First , both of these require the development of new processes, equipment, and/or 
systems.  With respect to dyna mic spectrum sharing, AT&T firs t notes that “ dynamic spectrum 
sharing” is a term used in many different contexts with very diffe rent meanings.  In its comments 
regarding the National Spectrum Strategy, AT&T proposed the following definition: a sharing mechanism that allows for spectrum access to  the same frequency band by two dissimilar 
spectrum users that varies in near-real time acro ss one or more other dimensions of spectrum 
use: geography, frequency, time, or power.  This would necessarily requir e the development of a 
means to facilitate such sharing.  Likewise, in the context of non-exclusive site-based licensing, 
such a regime would require the development of  new equipment.  All of this would take a 
significant amount of time and w ould prevent the Inventory Spect rum from being used in the 
interim.  Indeed, it is entirely possible that by the time this work is complete, the Commission’s 
auction authority wi ll have resumed. 
Second , both dynamic spectrum sharing and non-e xclusive licensing in these bands 
would require the development of technical rule s by the Commission.  This would be necessary 
to prevent co-channel and adjacen t-channel interference to incumb ent licensees with exclusive, 
primary rights.  The development of new tec hnical and service rules would, again, require 
significant time and Commission resources.",6,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"8 
 Third , even if time were no object, dynamic spectrum sharing and/or non-exclusive 
licensing in these bands would not attract the investment required to get them off the ground.  As 
noted above, either approach w ould require the development and marketing of new equipment.  
In many of the bands containing Inventory Spectrum, the availa ble spectrum in question only 
covers a handful of disparate blocks and mark et areas.  This means that there would be no 
economies of scale present to support the development of such equipment.    
For those spectrum blocks in Inventory Spect rum bands that have been auctioned, the 
public interest benefits are unde niable.  This spectrum has un leashed tremendous innovation and 
network performance and has helped connect wi reless users across the country.  Where this 
spectrum has been licensed, it is plai nly being put to its highest and be st use.  There is simply no 
justification for deviat ing from this model in the handful of markets and blocks where this 
spectrum remains in the FCC’s inventory.  Not only  would alternative appro aches fail to achieve 
the same benefits, but they  would also further delay the use of this spectrum and preclude the 
Commission’s ability to eventually auction it.  AT&T opposes such proposals.",7,FOR FILING AT&T Auction Alternatives Comments.pdf,AT&T SERVICES,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"9 
  
IV. CONCLUSION 
AT&T applauds the Commission for explor ing innovative approaches to make the 
Inventory Spectrum available to wireless consumers in the absence of statutory auction authority.  
AT&T’s preference would be for this auction authority to be restored as soon as possible, 
rendering this dialogue moot.  However, AT&T s upports the use of Specia l Temporary Authority 
to enable productive use of this spec trum in the near to medium term.

Re: Spectrum Rules and Policies for the Operation of UAS , WT Docket No. 22-323; WTB 
Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory 
Spectrum , WT Docket No. 24-72 
 
Dear Ms. Dortch: 
 
Florida Power & Light Company (“FPL”) respectfully urges the Federal Communications 
Commission (“Commission”) to establish a regulatory framework for uncrewed aircraft systems 
(“UAS”) by authorizing shared use in a portion of the 5030-5091 MHz band (“5 GHz band”) for UAS 
control and non-payload  communications (“CNPC”).  As explained below and demonstrated in the 
record, doing so would promote more efficient use of the 5 GHz band and growth of the emerging UAS 
industry, especially with regard to innovative use cases involving critical infrastructure industries 
(“CII”).  Just as importantly, the Commission can make meaningful progress in shaping the 5 GHz 
band’s future while it waits for Congress to renew its spectrum auction authority. 
 
The Commission Has Recognized That Access to Interference-Protected Spectrum is 
Necessary for UAS to Deliver on its Full Potential 
 
The UAS market is growing rapidly and expected to “more than triple” by 2030.1  As 
Commissioner Starks has stated, UAS is “an area where the United States can clearly lead with the right 
regulatory support.”2  The Commission took its first step to provide this regulatory support when it 
initiated a proceeding to establish service rules for the 5 GHz band and address UAS operators’

“growing need for the greater reliability that interference-protected licensed spectrum provides” for 
CNPC and other safety-related UAS communications.3 
 
The Commission has also recognized the “innumerable” public interest benefits of UAS,4 which 
are derived from important, innovative use cases, including (but not limited to) disaster relief, precision 
agriculture, and infrastructure development.  As these use cases suggest, UAS have become increasingly 
indispensable to CII operations,5 allowing utility companies like FPL to more safely inspect property 
for damage after a storm, efficiently monitor the health of a utility system during normal operations, and 
rapidly identify and address issues so that service to American consumers is better and more consistent.6 
 
Currently, entities like FPL conduct these UAS operations using unlicensed spectrum or 
spectrum made available under experimental licenses.7  But the lack of interference protection 
constrains these entities’ ability to maximize use of UAS.  For example, FPL was forced to limit use of 
its FPLAir One unmanned aircraft after Hurricane Ian because it was operating on unlicensed spectrum, 
which inhibited FPL’s ability to assess damage quickly and safely and restore power.8 
 
Licensed spectrum access would enable longer-range flights and more sophisticated UAS 
activities.  Therefore, access to licensed spectrum is necessary to increase use of this promising 
technology, especially for safety-critical communications.9  A permanent spectral home in the 5 GHz 
band would facilitate rapid deployment of UAS, including deployment by CII entities. 
 
The Commission Can Authorize Shared Use of the 5 GHz Band While It Continues to 
Develop the Record to Resolve Technical Issues 
 
The Commission anticipated that implementing service rules to facilitate UAS operations in the 
5 GHz band would require a phased approach because the technical work is still “in a nascent stage.”10  
Authorizing shared use of the 5 GHz band is a reasonable first phase, and the Commission can move

The Commission has successfully made spectrum available on a shared-use basis in other 
bands.12  Spectrum sharing managed by frequency coordinators capitalizes on technological advances 
that facilitate more intensive use of limited spectrum resources.13  Shared use in the 5 GHz band would 
maximize flexibility by allowing operators to determine the level of use they require in a shared segment 
at any given time.14  Additionally, shared use offers spectrum access for resource-constrained CII 
entities that may be priced out of an exclusive-use license at auction.15 
 
When authorizing shared use of the 5 GHz band, the Commission should permit only CNPC 
communications.16  Restricting the 5 GHz band to these mission-critical communications will ensure 
that they are adequately protected from harmful interference that otherwise could jeopardize flight 
safety.17  Importantly, this approach is consistent with the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA’s”) 
recommendation,18 supporting the Commission’s desire for a whole-of-government approach to ensure 
the safe, productive operation of UAS.19 
 
In contrast to the situation regarding shared CNPC communications, the record is not yet 
sufficiently developed to support non-CNPC communications.20  And although the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) identified the 5 GHz band for further 
study to “optimize UAS use” as part of the National Spectrum Strategy, with an expected completion 
date of March 2026,21 the need for further study on certain technical issues should not delay the

(1) Adopting a band plan and basic service rules that accommodate shared use for CNPC operations 
in segments of the 5 GHz band; and 
 
(2) Delegating authority to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (“WTB”) to accept 
applications that show evidence of frequency coordination to operate in the shared-use 
segments. 
 
To this end, the Commission could leverage the expertise of an existing frequency advisory 
committee – such as the Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council – to ensure that shared-
use spectrum in the 5 GHz band is deployed quickly and safely. 
 
In its National Spectrum Strategy, NTIA recognized that the Commission may use a phased 
approach and noted that the Commission “is expected to take near-term action  to facilitate limited 
deployment of UAS” in the band.22  Consistent with this plan, the Commission should initiate the first 
phase of a UAS framework by swiftly taking the actions described above while it works with NTIA, 
FAA, the UAS industry, and other stakeholders to develop a more comprehensive, long-term UAS 
framework for the 5 GHz band.  Recent filings in the record support such near-term action.23 
 
Spectrum Auction Authority Is Not Required to Authorize Shared-Use of the 5 GHz Band 
 
In a recent Public Notice, the Commission asked how it might use spectrum sharing to make 
available its spectrum inventory to the public despite its lack of spectrum auction authority.24 
 
Without auction authority, the Commission has limited ability to issue exclusive-use licenses  
(where issues of mutual exclusivity are likely to arise), including the geographic area licenses envisioned 
in the 5 GHz NPRM.25 
 
 
22 National Spectrum Strategy at 6 (emphasis added); see also  id. at Table 1 (acknowledging that “service rules 
to facilitate UAS likely will require development in phases”).

Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WT Docket No. 22-323, at 5 (Feb. 23, 2024) (stating that the record is “clear

However, Commission precedent makes clear that it may authorize shared use of spectrum 
without an auction.26  Therefore, the Commission could authorize UAS CNPC communications on a 
shared basis in the 5 GHz band without waiting for Congress to renew its spectrum auction authority. 
 
* * * 
 
As Chairwoman Rosenworcel recently stated, the Commission should “keep innovation 
moving ahead” despite its lapsed auction authority by using creative solutions to allocate spectrum.27 
 
Taking action now to implement the above would represent such a solution.  Specifically, 
authorizing shared use of part of the 5 GHz band for UAS CNPC communications, developing basic 
service rules that would rely on the expertise of an existing frequency coordinator, and delegating 
authority to the WTB to accept applications from prospective licensees that would use the shared-use 
segment of the 5 GHz band is precisely the type of action the Commission can take to promote such 
innovation. 
 
Doing so would promote the growth of the UAS industry, facilitate increased access to 
spectrum, and benefit consumers by creating a spectral home for mission-critical operations that enable 
innovative disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, precision agriculture, package delivery, and 
other valuable and important use cases.

COMMENTS OF ANTHONY L. JONES
I, Anthony L. Jones, respectfully submit these comments in 
response to a Federal Communications Commission (“Commission”) 
public notice seeking comment on how it may allocate presently 
unused spectrum currently lying fallow in the Commission’s 
inventory.1 These comments primarily focus on how I believe the 
Commission could allocate currently unused spectrum in the Paging
and Radiotelephone Service (“PARS”) while the Commission lacks 
authority to auction this spectrum.
I.THE COMMISSION SHOULD TEMPORARILY  RETURN TO THE ACCEPTANCE 
OF NEW SITE-BASED APPLICATIONS IN THE PARS AT ANY TIME FROM 
ANY INTERESTED PARTY
Before the Commission used auctions to assign PARS spectrum,
it accepted applications for new PARS stations on a site-by-site 
basis. Prospective PARS licensees self-coordinated using 
Commission-defined equations to plot service and interference 
contours to determine if any overlap creating destructive 
interference to an existing station would occur2 and Commission 
staff would use these calculations when considering whether or 
not the grant of the new proposed PARS application was 
achievable. I urge the Commission to issue a blanket waiver of 
any rules relating to the use of competitive bidding for PARS 
spectrum3 until auction authority has been reauthorized by 
Congress so that the Commission may accept from any interested 
party site-based applications for new PARS stations along with 
modification applications from existing PARS licensees seeking to

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU SEEKS COMMENT ON WAYS TO 
FACILITATE ACCESS TO CURRENTLY UNASSIGNED AUCTION INVENTORY 
SPECTRUM FOR WIRELESS RADIO SERVICES IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING 
LAPSE OF AUCTION AUTHORITY
WT Docket No. 24-72
Comments Due:  April 8, 2024
Reply Comments Due:  April 22, 2024
I. INTRODUCTION
1. This Public Notice seeks comment on how the Commission should fulfill its 
responsibility to make spectrum resources available for use in the public interest,1 in light of the ongoing 
lapse of the Commission’s auction authority.2  The Commission typically uses exclusive, geographic-area 
licensing to facilitate nationwide wireless broadband coverage, and auctions have been the most effective 
mechanism to resolve mutually exclusive applications for geographic-area licenses in a manner that yields 
the most benefits to the public.  Given the ongoing lapse of the Commission’s auction authority, the 
Commission now faces a unique and historic challenge of how to facilitate the deployment of advanced 
wireless services across the country without using auctions to resolve mutually exclusive applications.
2. To that end, unless and until Congress decides to restore the Commission’s auction 
authority, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) is compelled to explore how its existing 
regulatory tools could be used to provide the public with access to spectrum that would otherwise lie 
fallow.  Specifically, in this Public Notice, WTB seeks comment on how the Commission, if necessary, 
could use its current statutory authority to provide the public with access to its inventory of currently 
unassigned spectrum in bands previously licensed for wireless services through auctions (hereafter, 
Inventory Spectrum).  The record compiled in this proceeding will help WTB, in coordination with the 
Office of Economics and Analytics and the Office of Engineering and Technology, to develop options for 
Commission consideration of these issues.  We note that additional spectrum may also be affected by the 
1 See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 301, 303(g), 309(a), 1507. 
2 On March 9, 2023, the Commission’s authority to issue licenses through systems of competitive bidding (i.e., 
auction authority) expired.  47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(11) (“The authority of the Commission to grant a license or permit 
under this subsection shall expire March 9, 2023, except that, with respect to the electromagnetic spectrum identified 
under section 1004(a) of the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015, such authority shall expire on September 30, 2025, and 
with respect to the electromagnetic spectrum identified under section 90008(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, such authority shall expire on the date that is 7 years after November 15, 2021.”).  Since 
the lapse of general authority on March 9, 2023, Congress has provided a 90-day window for the Commission to 
grant licenses “in the band of frequencies between 2496 megahertz and 2690 megahertz, inclusive” not granted prior 
to the 5G SALE Act and applied for based on competitive bidding held prior to March 9, 2023.  See 5G Spectrum 
Authority Licensing Enforcement Act (5G SALE Act), P.L. 118-27, 137 Stat. 132 (2023).  Congress has not 
otherwise changed the Commission’s auction authority since it lapsed.",0,DA-24-215A1.pdf,Commission Documents,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

2lack of auction authority where, but for the current statutory limitations, the Commission might otherwise 
adopt rules for geographic area licensing and auctions to resolve mutual exclusivity.
3. This Public Notice identifies three broad approaches that the Commission could use to 
make Inventory Spectrum available for public use in the absence of auction authority.  These options 
include:  (1) providing access through dynamic spectrum sharing techniques; (2) providing access through 
non-exclusive site-based licensing; and (3) leasing spectrum inventory licenses.  We seek comment on 
each approach, as well as combinations of approaches (e.g., leasing inventory licenses and dynamic 
spectrum sharing) and any other methods that could be used to make Inventory Spectrum available to the 
public.
II. BACKGROUND
4. The Commission uses a wide variety of frameworks to authorize the use of spectrum 
resources throughout the country.  For example, the Commission may provide for the initial licensing of 
spectrum through geographic-area licensing, site-based licensing, and license-by-rule mechanisms, or 
may provide for unlicensed access to spectrum.  The Commission’s secondary market policies permit the 
assignment, transfer, partitioning, or disaggregation of geographic-area or site-based licenses.
5. In developing frameworks for assigning licenses for spectrum access, the Commission 
must address the potential for mutually exclusive applications for the licensed use of that spectrum, either 
by designing an authorization framework that avoids mutual exclusivity or by exercising its statutory 
authority to resolve mutually exclusive applications.3  With respect to resolving mutually exclusive 
applications, the statutory options available to the Commission have evolved over time.
6. The Commission previously used comparative hearings to assign licenses subject to 
mutually exclusive applications.4  Comparative hearings were highly cumbersome processes that required 
the Commission to evaluate applicants’ competing claims regarding the value of their spectrum use to the 
public interest.  These proceedings tended to result in numerous appeals, which delayed assignment of the 
licenses.  As a result of these deficiencies, Congress authorized random selection as an alternative to 
comparative hearings for the assignment of licenses.5  However, random selection oftentimes resulted in 
windfalls for speculators and the Commission’s authority to conduct assignment by random selection was 
subsequently terminated.6  Congress’ subsequent grant of auction authority to the FCC in 1993 provided a 
substantially more effective mechanism for resolving mutually exclusive applications for spectrum 
licenses.  Since the first spectrum auction in July 1994, over 3,300 winning bidders (of over 5,700 
3 Generally, the Commission “shall grant” an application for a license “when the public interest convenience and 
necessity would be served by granting” the application.  47 U.S.C. § 309(a).  The Communications Act originally 
provided that, when the Commission did not grant an application, the Commission “shall afford such applicant an 
opportunity to be heard.”  U.S.C. § 309(a) (1934).  The United States Supreme Court subsequently determined that 
when there are mutually exclusive applications pending, this statutory right to a hearing required that an applicant 
must be given an opportunity for a hearing prior to action on its application because “the grant of one [application] 
effectively precludes the other.”  Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, 326 U.S. 327, 330 (1945).  Though Congress 
subsequently limited the right to a hearing to circumstances in which “a substantial and material question of fact is 
presented,” 47 U.S.C. § 309(e), it seems likely that mutually exclusive applications often will give rise to such",1,DA-24-215A1.pdf,Commission Documents,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"presented,” 47 U.S.C. § 309(e), it seems likely that mutually exclusive applications often will give rise to such 
questions, given that the grant is to be determined by whether granting the respective applications will service “the 
public interest, convenience and necessity.”  47 U.S.C. § 309(a).  Of course, the Commission retains its authority to 
use engineering solutions, negotiation, threshold qualifications, service regulations, and other means in order to 
avoid mutual exclusivity.  See generally 47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(6)(E).

3qualified bidders) have won nearly 103,000 licenses or permits in 100 spectrum auctions.7  The 
Commission has raised over $233.5 billion for statutorily mandated uses, including: $39.8 billion for the 
Public Safety Trust Fund; $45.2 billion to the Spectrum Relocation Fund; and over $100 billion for the 
General Fund.  These auctions have helped to fuel competition, to provide consumers with a vast array of 
wireless technologies and services, and to increase the likelihood that the Nation’s scarce spectrum 
resources are put to their highest and best use.
7. The Commission’s current Inventory Spectrum includes numerous exclusive-use, 
geographic area-based licenses across multiple wireless services that were previously made available via 
competitive bidding but were either not acquired at auction or returned to the Commission after issuance.  
These include licenses capable of supporting broadband services (e.g., 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz 
Cellular, AWS-3, PCS, BRS, MVDDS) as well as those supporting narrowband services (e.g., 220 MHz, 
VHF/UHF Paging, 800 MHz SMR).  As a result of the ongoing lapse of the Commission’s auction 
authority, the Commission has limited statutory mechanisms to resolve mutually exclusive applications 
for Inventory Spectrum.  Accordingly, in developing frameworks for assigning Inventory Spectrum, the 
Commission could explore options that would avoid mutual exclusivity, or could resolve mutual 
exclusivity through a suboptimal mechanism like comparative hearings.  Notwithstanding this unique 
challenge, the Commission nonetheless has an obligation to consider opportunities for making Inventory 
Spectrum available for wireless communications through alternative means consistent with its current 
statutory authority.
III. DISCUSSION
A. Potential Approaches for Making Inventory Spectrum Available to the Public
8.Dynamic Spectrum Sharing.  In recent years, the Commission has successfully used 
dynamic spectrum sharing frameworks to make spectrum available for flexible wireless use across 
multiple bands, including licensed use in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service in the 3.55–3.7 GHz band 
(3.5 GHz band) and unlicensed use in portions of the 5.925–7.125 GHz band (6 GHz band).8  WTB seeks 
comment on whether similar dynamic spectrum sharing approaches could be used to facilitate access to 
Inventory Spectrum.  For example, one or more dynamic frequency coordinators could facilitate access to 
Inventory Spectrum for multiple users within particular spectrum bands and geographic areas.  These 
dynamic systems could be used to minimize harmful interference between operators and promote co-
existence between and among various spectrum users.  Access to these bands and geographic areas could 
7 See Federal Communications Commission, Auctions Summary, https://www.fcc.gov/auctions-summary (last 
visited Mar. 5, 2024).
8 The Commission has deployed dynamic frequency coordination models in certain contexts, including Spectrum 
Access Systems (SAS) for the 3.5 GHz band, and Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) Systems for the 6 GHz 
band.  See Amendment of the Commission’s Rules with Regard to Commercial Operations in the 3550–3650 MHz 
Band, GN Docket No. 12-354, Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd

Administrators); Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band, ET Docket No. 18-295, Report and Order and Further Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 3852 (2020) (6 GHz Report and Order).  SASs coordinate operations 
between three tiers of authorized users (Incumbents, Priority Access Licensees, and General Authorized Access 
users) in the 3.5 GHz band.  3.5 GHz Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4051, para. 311.  They set and enforce",2,DA-24-215A1.pdf,Commission Documents,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum
"users) in the 3.5 GHz band.  3.5 GHz Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4051, para. 311.  They set and enforce 
maximum permissible power levels in accordance with the applicable rules, and SASs must act quickly as needed to 
ensure co-existence between the various categories of authorized users.  Id. at 4052, paras. 314–15.  For standard-
power operations, standard-power access points and fixed client devices operate under the control of AFC systems 
in two portions of the 6 GHz band—the U-NII-5 band (5.925–6.425 GHz) and the U-NII-7 band (6.525–6.875 
GHz).  47 CFR § 15.407(k)(1); 6 GHz Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 3860, 3862, 3923, paras. 17–18, 22, 192.  
AFCs establish exclusion zones in the 6 GHz band, and they permit unlicensed access to the band only on 
frequencies and in locations that AFCs determine will protect incumbent operations—including fixed microwave 
operations and radio astronomy observatories—from harmful interference.  6 GHz Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd

4be driven by the existing service rules for the bands to protect existing users and provide a predictable 
framework for new entrants to the band.  Guidelines, optimized for each band, could be developed to help 
dynamic frequency coordinators facilitate co-existence among a variety of stakeholders and use cases.  
Are there aspects of the SAS or AFC models that could be incorporated into a dynamic spectrum sharing 
system to provide access to Inventory Spectrum?  How could the Commission leverage existing 
frequency coordination capabilities to more rapidly implement a dynamic spectrum sharing approach in 
these bands?  What would be the expected time and resources required to develop both the sensing and 
end-user equipment necessary to implement such dynamic sharing?  We also encourage commenters to 
address the specific questions posed in subpart B, below.
9.Non-Exclusive Site-Based Licensing.  For decades, the Commission has issued non-
exclusive wireless radio service licenses to entities to use spectrum in specific locations, consistent with 
existing allocations and service rules governing wireless services in those spectrum bands.9  Non-
exclusive site-based licensees are typically required to coordinate with one another—either licensee-to-
licensee or via a third-party frequency coordinator—to minimize harmful interference between operators 
in the band.  WTB seeks comment on whether such a non-exclusive site-based licensing approach—with 
or without a third-party spectrum coordinator—could be used to provide the public with access to 
Inventory Spectrum.  Under such an approach, stakeholders could seek individual, non-exclusive 
authorizations and promote co-existence through either a spectrum coordinator or licensee-to-licensee 
coordination of technical parameters.  In addition, to facilitate co-existence in a shared-use environment, 
the Commission could issue guidelines to promote licensee best practices in coordinating frequency use 
between and among licensees to avoid harmful interference.  Are there situations where the relatively 
simple non-exclusive site-based licensing approach would be preferable to a dynamic spectrum sharing 
approach?  If so, under what circumstances, and in which bands, would such an approach be 
advantageous?  Commenters should also address the questions posed in subpart B, below.
10.Leasing Spectrum Inventory Licenses.  In recent years, the Commission has taken steps to 
implement innovative approaches to spectrum leasing to facilitate more flexible and efficient access to 
spectrum resources.10  Could the Commission position Inventory Spectrum licenses so that they could be 
leased to the public, even if they have not yet been initially licensed?  If so, what guidelines could the 
Commission develop to govern lessee selection, leasing arrangements, resolution of mutually exclusive 
applications, and other parameters?  Are there benefits to such a leasing approach as compared to making 
spectrum available using either dynamic spectrum sharing techniques or site-based licensing as described 
above?  As with the other approaches, we invite commenters to respond to the questions in subpart B, 
below.  
11.Special Temporary Authority (STA).  We also note that the public already has access to 
Inventory Spectrum under limited circumstances and for limited purposes, specifically via grants of 
STAs.11  For example, WTB issued over 165,000 new licenses last year, of which more than 1,000 were

licensees shall cooperate in the selection and use of frequencies in order to reduce interference and make the most 
effective use of the authorized facilities. . . . [T]he use of any frequency may be restricted as to specified 
geographical areas, maximum power, or such other operating conditions, contained in this part or in the station",3,DA-24-215A1.pdf,Commission Documents,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

11 The Commission may grant applications for Special Temporary Authority (STA) in certain circumstances 
(including emergency requests), and for periods of up to 180 days.  Applications for STA are typically granted to 
permit immediate, temporary operation of certain radio facilities during emergencies or other temporary 
circumstances where warranted.  See 47 CFR § 1.931.",3,DA-24-215A1.pdf,Commission Documents,WTB Seeks Comment on Options for Facilitating Access to Unassigned Auction Inventory Spectrum

5STAs.  Given that this well-established access mechanism provides for non-interfering use of the 
spectrum, it will remain available to users irrespective of any other approaches that the Commission 
might propose in the future.  Are there changes to STA that might serve the public interest during this 
period of lapsed auction authority?  As with the other approaches, we invite commenters to respond to the 
questions in subpart B, below.
12.Other Options.  We invite commenters to consider other assignment options for 
providing access to the Commission’s spectrum inventory.  For example, would it be advantageous to 
create experimental innovation zones in some or all geographic areas where the Commission has 
Inventory Spectrum?  Under such an approach, users could experiment with different technical 
approaches, especially as it relates to dynamic spectrum sharing techniques, and information gained could 
then be applied to other geographic areas and spectrum bands to facilitate public access to Inventory 
Spectrum.  We also seek comment on whether aspects of any of the approaches discussed above could be 
combined to take advantage of the unique benefits of each access mechanism.
B. General Questions Regarding Access to Inventory Spectrum
13. To facilitate the consideration of alternative approaches to providing the public with 
access to Inventory Spectrum, WTB seeks comment on the questions below.  These questions apply to 
each of the approaches discussed herein, as well as any alternative approaches proposed by commenters.  
Commenters are encouraged to address these questions for each approach and are also encouraged to 
provide appropriate technical and cost benefit analyses in support of their proposals.  This valuable 
stakeholder input will inform the Bureau as it develops access options for Commission consideration.
•What are the potential benefits and drawbacks for each spectrum access mechanism?  For 
each access mechanism, what framework or guidelines could the Commission provide to 
ensure robust and efficient spectrum use, ensure a level playing field, prevent harmful 
interference, and promote co-existence among spectrum users? 
•To the extent that any of these mechanisms results in a change in the use of spectrum or in the 
service or technical rules for the spectrum, how should these mechanisms address potential 
co-channel and adjacent band interference issues?
•How might the Commission adjust any of the mechanisms to better incentivize network 
investment and robust use of the Inventory Spectrum in the public interest?
•Are any of these mechanisms more appropriate for use in particular Inventory Spectrum 
bands?  If so, what factors should we consider in studying whether to use a particular 
approach in a particular band? 
•For what term should access allowed under these mechanisms remain valid?  Should 
authorizations have a defined expiration?  Should the mechanisms authorize service only 
until auction authority is restored and, if so, how could these mechanisms facilitate the 
transition to use of the spectrum by entities who ultimately are assigned licenses through 
auction?
•How might the Commission address issues related to mutually exclusive applications, 
including its statutory authority to “use engineering solutions, negotiation, threshold 
qualifications, service regulations, and other means in order to avoid mutual exclusivity” to 
facilitate access to Inventory Spectrum?12
•What, if any, impact would each mechanism have on the Commission’s Mobile Spectrum 
Holdings policies?  How would the Mobile Spectrum Holdings policies be applied in the 
applicable bands for each proposed mechanism?
