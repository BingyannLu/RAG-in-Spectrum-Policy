"What is AT&T’s opinion to applying machine learning technology? 
","Noise Robustness
","AT&T has expressed strong support for leveraging new technologies, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance spectrum efficiency and optimize the use of limited spectrum resources. In their submissions to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), AT&T has outlined the benefits of ML and AI in network management, such as increasing spectral efficiency, enhancing radio transmission, and improving network reliability and security.

However, AT&T also emphasizes the need for caution in the implementation of ML and AI, particularly regarding the validity and potential biases of these technologies. They advocate for the controlled use of ML and AI within carrier networks where security controls are strict and the impact is confined to their own networks to avoid broader issues. This controlled environment ensures that customer data is protected and that the technology is only used in ways that enhance user experience and service quality​​.

Thus, AT&T sees significant potential in applying machine learning technology but stresses the importance of responsible deployment to ensure data integrity and user privacy.",,,,

"Who holds the opposite opinion to CTIA? 
","Information Integration
","NCTA – The Internet & Television Association seems to hold a position that contrasts with that of CTIA. While CTIA argues for focusing on bands that are not subject to competitive market pressures, NCTA emphasizes the need to consider a variety of metrics beyond just spectrum occupancy to assess the true utility and efficiency of spectrum use, regardless of the market pressures. NCTA argues against a one-size-fits-all approach for measuring spectrum utilization and suggests that the Commission's efforts be adaptable to different needs and circumstances. They stress the importance of considering the characteristics of specific bands and technologies when designing measurement approaches, and that any measurement effort should serve a well-articulated goal.

NCTA also points out that some assertions made by CTIA, such as the idea that exclusive licensing automatically results in full utilization and efficiency, may not be accurate. Instead, NCTA notes that exclusive licenses can lead to barriers to entry and potential under-utilization of spectrum resources. They further advocate for the inclusion of measurements in both licensed-exclusive and shared-use bands, arguing that shared-use frameworks, like the Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS), are highly utilized and efficient due to their dynamic nature and incentives for efficient use. NCTA also cautions against using measurement campaigns as a tactic to block new entrants or competition in the marketplace.

Thus, NCTA's position is that the Commission should adopt a more nuanced and tailored approach to spectrum measurement that takes into account the varied uses and benefits of different spectrum bands and service frameworks, as opposed to CTIA's approach, which suggests a narrower focus on bands without competitive market incentives.

What is AT&T’s opinion?,"Information Integration
","AT&T Services, Inc. submits a letter to the FCC advocating for the reclassification of the proceeding ""Advancing Understanding of Non-Federal Spectrum Usage"" from ""exempt"" to ""permit-but-disclose"" under the Commission's ex parte rules. AT&T argues that this reclassification would enhance transparency and accessibility of information to all participants, particularly benefiting smaller entities that lack resources to engage directly with the Commission. They emphasize that such transparency aligns with the FCC's longstanding policy and would not impose significant burdens on parties already capable of meeting with the Commission due to the incremental nature of preparing ex parte presentation notices. Also, AT&T provides detailed comments on the FCC’s inquiry into non-federal spectrum usage. They stress the importance of optimizing the use of spectrum resources but caution against broad, undirected data collection without specific policy goals. AT&T suggests that the FCC should clearly define spectrum efficiency objectives for each band and tailor data collection accordingly to avoid unnecessary burdens and privacy risks. They also discuss the importance of incentives for efficient spectrum use, particularly highlighting the role of exclusive licensing and flexible regulatory policies in promoting significant investments and innovations in mobile broadband networks. Furthermore, AT&T criticizes one-size-fits-all approaches to measuring spectrum usage, advocating for evaluations that consider the unique characteristics and requirements of different spectrum bands. They conclude by emphasizing the need for a cautious approach to deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence in spectrum management, suggesting that such technologies be used selectively and under strict controls to prevent misuse and protect user data",,,,
