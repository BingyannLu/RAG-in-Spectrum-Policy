What's Qualcomm's opinion to national spectrum strategy?,Noise Robustness,"Support for Increased Spectrum Access: Qualcomm stresses the necessity for more spectrum to accommodate the rising use of wireless infrastructure, including advancements in 5G and future 6G technologies.
Advocacy for Spectrum Sharing: The company advocates for innovative spectrum sharing solutions, recognizing that all spectrum bands have incumbents and that sharing solutions need to be tailored to specific bands and current users. Qualcomm highlights its ongoing efforts to develop sharing technologies that allow for effective coexistence of multiple users without interference.
The Importance of a Regulatory Framework: Qualcomm underscores the need for a regulatory environment that supports clear and exclusive spectrum licenses, alongside the crucial role of unlicensed spectrum in supporting Wi-Fi and other technologies. They advocate for a balanced approach that facilitates both licensed and unlicensed spectrum usage.
Future Spectrum Needs: Looking ahead, Qualcomm points out the critical future requirements for spectrum due to the expected explosive growth in data traffic and emerging high-bandwidth applications like AR/VR. They suggest that the U.S. must continue to lead in identifying and making available new spectrum bands to maintain technological and economic leadership.
Collaborative Approach: The company calls for a collaborative approach among all stakeholders, including federal agencies, to ensure that the U.S. can continue to lead in advanced communications technologies. They emphasize the need for a strategy that adaploys both current and future technologies to maximize spectrum utilization.
Technological Innovation and Policy: Qualcomm discusses their contributions to spectrum technology, proposing specific innovative solutions for spectrum sharing and expressing readiness to partner with the government in implementing these technologies effectively.
Overall, Qualcomm's response is highly supportive of a strategic, forward-looking national spectrum strategy that accommodates growing technological needs while promoting efficient and effective use of spectrum resources. They advocate for policies that encourage innovation, investment, and a collaborative approach to spectrum management.",,,,
Why does Prof.Ghosh recommand increasing the quantity of locally licensed spectrum?,Noise Robustness,"Prof. Ghosh supports increasing locally licensed spectrum to better serve use cases that unlicensed and fully licensed bands can't meet, like schools and factories. These low-power, flexible deployments improve efficiency, coexist with federal users, and fill a critical gap in current allocations, where shared spectrum is severely limited.",,,,
Who holds the similar opinion with Dr.Laneman that the U.S. should build a NCO?,Information Integration,NSC believes that  the U.S. could create a National Coordination Office (NCO) for Spectrum Innovation to holistically guide spectrum-related research and development activities as well as workforce development efforts.,,,,
Whose opinion is opposite to CTIA's?,Information Integration,"NCTAâ€”The Internet & Television Association holds a contrasting opinion with CTIA regarding the development of a National Spectrum Strategy. NCTA emphasizes the importance of embracing a more flexible and inclusive spectrum allocation strategy, including both licensed and unlicensed spectrum, to foster innovation and competition. They advocate for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to spectrum use that incorporates licensed-exclusive, licensed-shared, and unlicensed access to accommodate a wide range of users and technologies. This stands in contrast to CTIA's focus, which prioritizes identifying and auctioning additional mid-band spectrum for exclusive, full-power commercial wireless use, underscoring the need for more exclusively licensed spectrum to support economic and national security interests.

NCTA highlights the successes of spectrum sharing models, like the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), which they argue demonstrate the viability and benefits of non-exclusive spectrum usage. They advocate for the inclusion of licensed-shared and unlicensed bands in the spectrum pipeline to reflect the diverse needs of today's wireless ecosystem, which relies heavily on Wi-Fi and other technologies that do not require exclusive spectrum access.

In summary, while CTIA argues for more exclusive-use spectrum to ensure the U.S. maintains its leadership in global communications and to meet increasing data demands, NCTA pushes for a balanced approach that includes shared and unlicensed spectrum to encourage broader access and innovation.",,,,
